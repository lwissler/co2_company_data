(Ryder), a Florida corporation founded in 1933, is a global leader in commercial fleet management and supply chain solutions. We\noperate primarily in three business segments: Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), Dedicated Transportation Services (DTS) and Supply Chain\nSolutions (SCS). Ryder has received significant awards and recognition from customers, leading transportation and logistics industry associations,\nbusiness and regulatory communities. Recent examples include: Forbes: America\u2019s Best Employers in Transportation and Logistics industry category\n(2016-2018); FORTUNE: World\u2019s Most Admired Companies Award in Trucking Industry (2016-2018); SupplyChainBrain - 100 Great Supply Chain\nPartners award (2017); Trucking HR Canada \u2013 Top Fleet Employers (2018); Carbon Disclosure Project Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (2012,\n2015); Food Logistics: Top Green Providers award for green transportation and logistics solutions (2012 \u2013 2017); Inbound Logistics - top 75 Green\nSupply Chain Partners by Inbound Logistics (2009\u2013 2017); Supply & Demand Chain Executive: Green Supply Chain Award for meeting green or\nsustainable supply chain goals (2016-2017); 2020 Women on Boards W Company \u2013 Ryder was named a \u201CW\u201D company for having a board with more\nthan 20 percent women (2013, 2017); CivilianJobs.com\u2019s Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military (2013 - 2017); Florida Diversity Council: Most\nPowerful and Influential Women Award (2017); SmartWay Excellence Award (2017). The FMS business provides full service leasing (long-term),\ncommercial rental (short-term), as well as contract maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.\nThe standard leasing business model offers customers different vehicle options (such as fuel-efficient or natural gas powered vehicle packages) with\nattractive financing mechanisms. Because of increased demand for vehicle efficiency and reliability, companies that own and manage their own fleet of\nvehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of preventative maintenance for their vehicles. In addition, several trends have been increasing the\nneed for outsourcing: increased complexity and cost of buying and maintaining vehicles including technology, diagnostics, and training; labor issues\nincluding a shortage of qualified truck drivers and mechanics; as well as increased regulation \u2013 e.g. more expensive emission controls needed for EPA-\ncompliant engines - and enforcement of safety requirements. The Dedicated Transportation Service (DTS) option provides vehicles and drivers as part\nof a dedicate transportation solution in the US. Customers directly manage their overall freight movement but Ryder provides the equipment,\nmaintenance, and administrative services (including driver hiring, training, routing and scheduling, and fleet sizing) associated with maintaining the\n1\nRyder System, Inc. CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2019 Friday, August 2, 2019\ncustomer\u2019s private fleet. This combination of services allow us to provide high service levels and the most efficient routing to lower fuel costs due to\nless idle time and fewer empty miles. A key difference between Dedicated Transportation Services and Full Service Lease is Ryder provides the drivers\nfor Dedicated. The SCS supply chain solution provides Distribution and Transportation Management services in North America and Asia. SCS\ncustomers are looking for a total integrated solution that includes managing outsourced vehicles, drivers, freight routing, IT integration, warehouse and\ndistribution management, as well as other logistics engineering services. SCS provides a wide range of services relating to a customer\u2019s distribution\noperations, from designing the distribution network to managing distribution facilities. Customers can more precisely align inbound and outbound\nshipments, synchronize returns with optimized fleet use and arrange backhauls to offset transportation costs and minimize empty miles that will directly\nhelp lowering GHG emissions. The SCS Transportation Management business offers services relating to all aspects of a customer\u2019s transportation\nnetwork. Ryder\u2019s transportation specialists provide shipment planning and execution, through a series of technological and web-based solutions.\nRyder published an updated Corporate Sustainability Report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards Core option with\ndetailed emissions and activity data (http:\/\/rydercsr.com). For the 2019 CDP response year, updates are provided to emission data (sections C6, C7\nand C8), but at the time of CDP publication, these were not fully audited. Ryder plans to resume full CDP reporting in 2020.","Company_id":"5eed2b474fe2bd337cd9ab6f","Name":"Ryder System"},"Scope 3":{"CO2":230126},"Scope 2":{"StartDate":"2018-01-01","CO2":118889,"EndDate":"2018-12-31","CO2 market based":117963},"ReportingStandard":"The Climate Registry","Source":{"URL":"https:\/\/ryder.com\/-\/media\/ryder\/ryder-global\/about-us\/sustainability\/adarydersysteminccdpclimatechangequestionnaire201920190802145748.pdf"}}}

Information technology (\u201CIT\u201D) driven innovation continues to disrupt markets and industries. Technologies emerge faster than organizations can absorb, creating increasingly complex environments. IT is working at an accelerated pace to harness new technologies, platforms and cloud models, ultimately guiding their business through a digital transformation. To take on these challenges, we are working with customers in the areas of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, modern applications, networking and security, and digital workspaces. Our software provides a flexible digital foundation to help enable customers in their digital transformation.\nWe help customers manage their IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments by offering solutions across three categories: Software-Defined Data Center (\u201CSDDC\u201D), Hybrid Cloud Computing and End-User Computing (\u201CEUC\u201D). This portfolio supports and addresses the key IT priorities of our customers: accelerating their cloud journey, empowering digital workspaces and transforming networking and security. These VMware solutions enable the digital transformation our customers need as they ready their applications, infrastructure and devices for their future business needs.\nWe incorporated in Delaware in 1998, were acquired by EMC Corporation (\u201CEMC\u201D) in 2004 and conducted our initial public offering of our Class A common stock in August 2007.
