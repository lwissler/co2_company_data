We\noperate primarily in three business segments: Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), Dedicated Transportation Services (DTS) and Supply Chain\nSolutions (SCS). Ryder has received significant awards and recognition from customers, leading transportation and logistics industry associations,\nbusiness and regulatory communities. Recent examples include: Forbes: America\u2019s Best Employers in Transportation and Logistics industry category\n(2016-2018); FORTUNE: World\u2019s Most Admired Companies Award in Trucking Industry (2016-2018); SupplyChainBrain - 100 Great Supply Chain\nPartners award (2017); Trucking HR Canada \u2013 Top Fleet Employers (2018); Carbon Disclosure Project Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (2012,\n2015); Food Logistics: Top Green Providers award for green transportation and logistics solutions (2012 \u2013 2017); Inbound Logistics - top 75 Green\nSupply Chain Partners by Inbound Logistics (2009\u2013 2017); Supply & Demand Chain Executive: Green Supply Chain Award for meeting green or\nsustainable supply chain goals (2016-2017); 2020 Women on Boards W Company \u2013 Ryder was named a \u201CW\u201D company for having a board with more\nthan 20 percent women (2013, 2017); CivilianJobs.com\u2019s Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military (2013 - 2017); Florida Diversity Council: Most\nPowerful and Influential Women Award (2017); SmartWay Excellence Award (2017). The FMS business provides full service leasing (long-term),\ncommercial rental (short-term), as well as contract maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.\nThe standard leasing business model offers customers different vehicle options (such as fuel-efficient or natural gas powered vehicle packages) with\nattractive financing mechanisms. Because of increased demand for vehicle efficiency and reliability, companies that own and manage their own fleet of\nvehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of preventative maintenance for their vehicles. In addition, several trends have been increasing the\nneed for outsourcing: increased complexity and cost of buying and maintaining vehicles including technology, diagnostics, and training; labor issues\nincluding a shortage of qualified truck drivers and mechanics; as well as increased regulation \u2013 e.g. more expensive emission controls needed for EPA-\ncompliant engines - and enforcement of safety requirements. The Dedicated Transportation Service (DTS) option provides vehicles and drivers as part\nof a dedicate transportation solution in the US. Customers directly manage their overall freight movement but Ryder provides the equipment,\nmaintenance, and administrative services (including driver hiring, training, routing and scheduling, and fleet sizing) associated with maintaining the\n1\nRyder System, Inc. CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2019 Friday, August 2, 2019\ncustomer\u2019s private fleet. This combination of services allow us to provide high service levels and the most efficient routing to lower fuel costs due to\nless idle time and fewer empty miles. A key difference between Dedicated Transportation Services and Full Service Lease is Ryder provides the drivers\nfor Dedicated. The SCS supply chain solution provides Distribution and Transportation Management services in North America and Asia. SCS\ncustomers are looking for a total integrated solution that includes managing outsourced vehicles, drivers, freight routing, IT integration, warehouse and\ndistribution management, as well as other logistics engineering services. SCS provides a wide range of services relating to a customer\u2019s distribution\noperations, from designing the distribution network to managing distribution facilities. Customers can more precisely align inbound and outbound\nshipments, synchronize returns with optimized fleet use and arrange backhauls to offset transportation costs and minimize empty miles that will directly\nhelp lowering GHG emissions. The SCS Transportation Management business offers services relating to all aspects of a customer\u2019s transportation\nnetwork. Ryder\u2019s transportation specialists provide shipment planning and execution, through a series of technological and web-based solutions.\nRyder published an updated Corporate Sustainability Report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards Core option with\ndetailed emissions and activity data (http:\/\/rydercsr.com). For the 2019 CDP response year, updates are provided to emission data (sections C6, C7\nand C8), but at the time of CDP publication, these were not fully audited. Ryder plans to resume full CDP reporting in 2020.","Company_id":"5eed2b474fe2bd337cd9ab6f","Name":"Ryder System"},"Scope 3":{"CO2":230126},"Scope 2":{"StartDate":"2018-01-01","CO2":118889,"EndDate":"2018-12-31","CO2 market based":117963},"ReportingStandard":"The Climate Registry","Source":"https:\/\/ryder.com\/-\/media\/ryder\/ryder-global\/about-us\/sustainability\/adarydersysteminccdpclimatechangequestionnaire201920190802145748.pdf"}}

Freeport-McMoRan is the world's largest publicly traded copper producer.\nFreeport-McMoRan's portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits; significant mining operations in the Americas, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in North America and the Cerro Verde operation in South America; the Tenke Fungurume minerals district in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); and significant oil and natural gas assets in North America, including reserves in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM), onshore and offshore California, in the Eagle Ford shale play in Texas, in the Haynesville shale plays in Louisiana, in the Madden area in Central Wyoming, and an industry-leading position in the emerging Inboard Lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous natural gas trend in the shallow waters of the GOM and onshore in South Louisiana.\nOur oil and gas subsidiary, FM O&G, formed in the second-quarter 2013, is excluded from our response.\nCopper, molybdenum and cobalt are part of a supply chain on which modern society depends. We are a significant supplier of critical metals to the world\u2019s economies. The generation and transmission of electricity, our means of communications and transportation, and the infrastructure that surrounds us all depend on the metals we produce. In 2013, copper accounted for approximately 69% of our revenues. As we look to the future, copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for energy efficiencies, to advance communications and to enhance public health. Copper\u2019s end- use markets (and their estimated shares of total consumption) are electrical applications 34%, construction 31%, industrial machinery 13%, transportation 13% and consumer products 9%. Molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemical-grade products used in catalysts, lubrication, smoke suppression, corrosion inhibition and pigmentation. Molybdenum, as a high-purity metal, is also used in electronics such as flat-panel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace. Cobalt is widely used in industry, as an important metal in super alloys for jet engines, in healthcare, and in alternative energy.\nOur greenhouse gas emissions are directly correlated to changes in mining production, which is generally correlated to global economic activity. Our current business plans are expected to require increased haul truck fuel consumption caused by longer and steeper material haulage and higher mining rates. As a result, because material haulage is a significant component of our direct emissions profile, without a change in technology applicable to our mining operations, our business plans indicate increasing direct emissions (both absolute and intensity-based emissions) from these existing facilities.

Nevertheless, Freeport-McMoRan is committed to developing\ngreenhouse gas emission reduction strategies, a number of which are developed at Freeport-McMoRan research and development facilities. One of these strategies is to increase the use of purchased power that comes from renewable or low-carbon sources when feasible. A second strategy is to implement energy efficient mineral processing technologies when we are expanding our production. Even with the implementation of these strategies, our business plans anticipate increased total emissions as we respond to increasing demand for our products, principally copper.\nC","Company_id":"5eed27ea4fe2bd337cd15baa","Name":"Freeport-McMoRan"},"Scope 3":{"CO2":null},"Scope 2":{"StartDate":"2013-01-01","CO2":null,"EndDate":"2013-12-31","CO2 market based":null},"ReportingStandard":"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol","Source":"https:\/\/fcx.com\/sites\/fcx\/files\/documents\/sustainability\/2014_cdp_info_req.pdf"}}
