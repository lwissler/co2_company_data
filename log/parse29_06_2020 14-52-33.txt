Ryder has received significant awards and recognition from customers, leading transportation and logistics industry associations,\nbusiness and regulatory communities. Recent examples include: Forbes: America\u2019s Best Employers in Transportation and Logistics industry category\n(2016-2018); FORTUNE: World\u2019s Most Admired Companies Award in Trucking Industry (2016-2018); SupplyChainBrain - 100 Great Supply Chain\nPartners award (2017); Trucking HR Canada \u2013 Top Fleet Employers (2018); Carbon Disclosure Project Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (2012,\n2015); Food Logistics: Top Green Providers award for green transportation and logistics solutions (2012 \u2013 2017); Inbound Logistics - top 75 Green\nSupply Chain Partners by Inbound Logistics (2009\u2013 2017); Supply & Demand Chain Executive: Green Supply Chain Award for meeting green or\nsustainable supply chain goals (2016-2017); 2020 Women on Boards W Company \u2013 Ryder was named a \u201CW\u201D company for having a board with more\nthan 20 percent women (2013, 2017); CivilianJobs.com\u2019s Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military (2013 - 2017); Florida Diversity Council: Most\nPowerful and Influential Women Award (2017); SmartWay Excellence Award (2017). The FMS business provides full service leasing (long-term),\ncommercial rental (short-term), as well as contract maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.\nThe standard leasing business model offers customers different vehicle options (such as fuel-efficient or natural gas powered vehicle packages) with\nattractive financing mechanisms. Because of increased demand for vehicle efficiency and reliability, companies that own and manage their own fleet of\nvehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of preventative maintenance for their vehicles. In addition, several trends have been increasing the\nneed for outsourcing: increased complexity and cost of buying and maintaining vehicles including technology, diagnostics, and training; labor issues\nincluding a shortage of qualified truck drivers and mechanics; as well as increased regulation \u2013 e.g. more expensive emission controls needed for EPA-\ncompliant engines - and enforcement of safety requirements. The Dedicated Transportation Service (DTS) option provides vehicles and drivers as part\nof a dedicate transportation solution in the US. Customers directly manage their overall freight movement but Ryder provides the equipment,\nmaintenance, and administrative services (including driver hiring, training, routing and scheduling, and fleet sizing) associated with maintaining the\n1\nRyder System, Inc.

This combination of services allow us to provide high service levels and the most efficient routing to lower fuel costs due to\nless idle time and fewer empty miles. A key difference between Dedicated Transportation Services and Full Service Lease is Ryder provides the drivers\nfor Dedicated. The SCS supply chain solution provides Distribution and Transportation Management services in North America and Asia. SCS\ncustomers are looking for a total integrated solution that includes managing outsourced vehicles, drivers, freight routing, IT integration, warehouse and\ndistribution management, as well as other logistics engineering services. SCS provides a wide range of services relating to a customer\u2019s distribution\noperations, from designing the distribution network to managing distribution facilities. Customers can more precisely align inbound and outbound\nshipments, synchronize returns with optimized fleet use and arrange backhauls to offset transportation costs and minimize empty miles that will directly\nhelp lowering GHG emissions.

In alignment with more than 190 countries, we support the Paris Agreement on climate change, its commitment to take action to keep global temperature rise this century to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and its efforts to limit the temperature increase to no more than 1.5°C. Doing so will require changes in all sectors of our economy, particularly the transformation of critical areas like energy, power, transportation and real estate. Bank of America will mobilize an additional $300 billion in capital by 2030 through its Environmental Business Initiative. This third commitment increases the company\u2019s investment in low-carbon business activities as part of its focus on deploying capital for responsible, sustainable growth. Through lending, investing, capital raising, advisory services and developing financing solutions, this new commitment will drive innovation and help to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy. The $300 billion goal brings Bank of America\u2019s total commitment to more than $445 billion since 2007, when the company issued its first Environmental Business Initiative. Bank of America has deployed more than $126 billion over the past 12 years in support of environmental business efforts across the globe.

The Group is a worldwide leader in the habitat and construction markets, providing\ncomfort, performance and safety while addressing the challenges of sustainable construction,\nresource efficiency and climate change all over the world. As a growing number of countries\npass new regulations in favor of more energy-efficient buildings, it encourages the introduction\nof innovative construction techniques for new buildings along with new insulation standards for\nrenovation projects. At the same time, urbanization is a major trend that is affecting the\nconstruction market in both developed and emerging countries. The rapid exponential growth in\ninfrastructure needs and increasing demand for energy-efficient solutions represent valuable\nopportunities for Saint-Gobain. With its unique positioning, Saint-Gobain is among the first to\nbenefit from the environmentally led growth in the construction market. Innovation is at the\nheart of Saint-Gobain\u2019s strategy. To support that vision and continuously improve its processes\nand products, Saint-Gobain invests heavily in R and D. For the past eight years, the Group has\nbeen ranked in the Top 100 Innovators by Clarivate. Over 80% of the Group\u2019s sales occur in\nthe construction markets, including new construction, renovation, civil engineering and\ninfrastructure. Considerable change is on the way in interior and exterior insulation solutions.\nThe major part of our products (flat glass, glass wool, plasterboard, exterior wall and floor\ncoating mortars) already helps to make buildings more energy efficient for the end user and we\nintend to further improve their performance in the future. The Group has announced in 2018 a\nnew organization, effective from 2019. Saint-Gobain's previous structure relied on a matrix-\nbased system with three Sectors of activity (Innovative Materials, Construction Products,\nBuilding Distribution) and 14 General Delegations coordinating the Group's actions and\nrepresenting it in its various countries. The new structure is as follows: - Activities in regional\nmarkets (activities from the former Building Distribution and Construction Products, as well as\nbuilding glass) are now organized by country and consolidated into four regions (Northern\nEurope; Southern Europe, Middle-East, Africa; Americas; Asia-Pacific). In markets where\nproducts and services are supplied locally and mostly have short distances to cover, the\nstructure per country and region will leverage Saint-Gobain's strengths to meet the specific\nneeds of each local market. - A High Performance Solutions entity is responsible for global\nmarket activities (corresponding to the former High-Performance Materials Sector as well as the\nautomotive glazing activities). These are products and services with a high unit value that can\nbe shipped over long distances and whose value is often created through co-innovation with\ncustomers and bespoke technologies. The High Performance Solutions BUs provide the best\nservice to the various markets with three market-oriented BUs (Mobility, Life sciences,\nSaint-Gobain CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2019 Thursday, July 4, 2019\n2\nConstruction Industry) and two BUs serving industry more generally (one channel-oriented\nAbrasives and Composite Systems BU and one product-oriented Ceramics BU). To showcase\nand monitor its strong engagement towards sustainability, Saint-Gobain has set for itself a\nnumber of ambitious targets in the areas of environment including CO2 emissions and energy\nconsumption. Those targets are set up for the plants being representative of the impact of the\nGroup. In 2018, around 500 plants are concerned. In the area of sustainable development and\ncorporate social responsibility, Saint-Gobain is included on the MSCI World ESG Leaders,\nSTOXX® Global ESG Leaders, Euronext-Vigeo Europe 120, Euronext Vigeo Eurozone 120,\nEthibel ESI Excellence Global, Ethibel ESI Excellence Europe, FTSE4Good indices and Dow\nJones Sustainability Index.

(Ryder), a Florida corporation founded in 1933, is a global leader in commercial fleet management and supply chain solutions. We operate primarily in three business segments: Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), Dedicated Transportation Services (DTS) and Supply Chain Solutions (SCS). Ryder has received significant awards and recognition from customers, leading transportation and logistics industry associations, business and regulatory communities. Recent examples include: Forbes: America\u2019s Best Employers in Transportation and Logistics industry category (2016-2018); FORTUNE: World\u2019s Most Admired Companies Award in Trucking Industry (2016-2018); SupplyChainBrain - 100 Great Supply Chain Partners award (2017); Trucking HR Canada \u2013 Top Fleet Employers (2018); Carbon Disclosure Project Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (2012, 2015); Food Logistics: Top Green Providers award for green transportation and logistics solutions (2012 \u2013 2017); Inbound Logistics - top 75 Green Supply Chain Partners by Inbound Logistics (2009\u2013 2017); Supply & Demand Chain Executive: Green Supply Chain Award for meeting green or sustainable supply chain goals (2016-2017); 2020 Women on Boards W Company \u2013 Ryder was named a \u201CW\u201D company for having a board with more than 20 percent women (2013, 2017); CivilianJobs.com\u2019s Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military (2013 - 2017); Florida Diversity Council: Most Powerful and Influential Women Award (2017); SmartWay Excellence Award (2017).The FMS business provides full service leasing (long-term), commercial rental (short-term), as well as contract maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The standard leasing business model offers customers different vehicle options (such as fuel-efficient or natural gas powered vehicle packages) with attractive financing mechanisms. Because of increased demand for vehicle efficiency and reliability, companies that own and manage their own fleet of vehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of preventative maintenance for their vehicles. In addition, several trends have been increasing the need for outsourcing: increased complexity and cost of buying and maintaining vehicles including technology, diagnostics, and training; labor issues including a shortage of qualified truck drivers and mechanics; as well as increased regulation \u2013 e.g. more expensive emission controls needed for EPA-compliant engines - and enforcement of safety requirements. Under the FMS Full Service Lease option, Ryder offers vehicle maintenance services, supplies and related equipment necessary for operating and maintaining lease vehicles. This applies to customers who want to manage their own freight, but are interested in outsourcing or upgrading their fleet\nmanagement needs without having to invest their own capital. Under the FMS Commercial Rental option, customers who need to supplement their fleet on a short-term basis are able to rent vehicles for a day, a week, a month, or on a multi-year rental contract. The Dedicated Transportation Service (DTS) option provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicate transportation solution in the\nUS. Customers directly manage their overall freight movement but Ryder provides the equipment, maintenance, and administrative services (including driver hiring, training, routing and scheduling, and fleet sizing) associated with maintaining the customer\u2019s private fleet. This combination of services allow us to provide high service levels and the most efficient routing to lower fuel costs due to less idle time and fewer empty miles. A key difference between Dedicated Transportation Services and Full Service Lease is Ryder provides the drivers for Dedicated. The SCS supply chain solution provides Distribution and Transportation Management services in North America and Asia. SCS customers are looking for a total integrated solution that includes managing outsourced vehicles, drivers, freight routing, IT integration, warehouse and distribution management, as well as other logistics engineering services. SCS provides a wide range of services relating to a customer\u2019s distribution operations, from designing the distribution network to managing distribution facilities. Customers can more precisely align inbound and outbound shipments, synchronize returns with optimized fleet use and arrange backhauls to offset transportation costs and minimize empty miles that will directly help lowering GHG emissions. The SCS Transportation Management business offers services relating to all aspects of a customer\u2019s transportation network. Ryder\u2019s transportation specialists provide shipment planning and execution, through a series of technological and web-based solutions.","Company_id":"5eed2b474fe2bd337cd9ab6f","Name":"Ryder System"},"Scope 3":{"CO2":268034},"Scope 2":{"StartDate":null,"CO2":null,"EndDate":null,"CO2 market based":114760},"ReportingStandard":"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol","Source":{"URL":"https:\/\/ryder.com\/-\/media\/ryder\/ryder-global\/about-us\/sustainability\/ada_2018-cdp-ryder-response.pdf"}}
