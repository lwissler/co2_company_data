Recent examples include: Forbes: America\u2019s Best Employers in Transportation and Logistics industry category\n(2016-2018); FORTUNE: World\u2019s Most Admired Companies Award in Trucking Industry (2016-2018); SupplyChainBrain - 100 Great Supply Chain\nPartners award (2017); Trucking HR Canada \u2013 Top Fleet Employers (2018); Carbon Disclosure Project Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (2012,\n2015); Food Logistics: Top Green Providers award for green transportation and logistics solutions (2012 \u2013 2017); Inbound Logistics - top 75 Green\nSupply Chain Partners by Inbound Logistics (2009\u2013 2017); Supply & Demand Chain Executive: Green Supply Chain Award for meeting green or\nsustainable supply chain goals (2016-2017); 2020 Women on Boards W Company \u2013 Ryder was named a \u201CW\u201D company for having a board with more\nthan 20 percent women (2013, 2017); CivilianJobs.com\u2019s Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military (2013 - 2017); Florida Diversity Council: Most\nPowerful and Influential Women Award (2017); SmartWay Excellence Award (2017). The FMS business provides full service leasing (long-term),\ncommercial rental (short-term), as well as contract maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.\nThe standard leasing business model offers customers different vehicle options (such as fuel-efficient or natural gas powered vehicle packages) with\nattractive financing mechanisms. Because of increased demand for vehicle efficiency and reliability, companies that own and manage their own fleet of\nvehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of preventative maintenance for their vehicles. In addition, several trends have been increasing the\nneed for outsourcing: increased complexity and cost of buying and maintaining vehicles including technology, diagnostics, and training; labor issues\nincluding a shortage of qualified truck drivers and mechanics; as well as increased regulation \u2013 e.g. more expensive emission controls needed for EPA-\ncompliant engines - and enforcement of safety requirements. The Dedicated Transportation Service (DTS) option provides vehicles and drivers as part\nof a dedicate transportation solution in the US. Customers directly manage their overall freight movement but Ryder provides the equipment,\nmaintenance, and administrative services (including driver hiring, training, routing and scheduling, and fleet sizing) associated with maintaining the\n1\nRyder System, Inc. CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2019 Friday, August 2, 2019\ncustomer\u2019s private fleet. This combination of services allow us to provide high service levels and the most efficient routing to lower fuel costs due to\nless idle time and fewer empty miles. A key difference between Dedicated Transportation Services and Full Service Lease is Ryder provides the drivers\nfor Dedicated. The SCS supply chain solution provides Distribution and Transportation Management services in North America and Asia. SCS\ncustomers are looking for a total integrated solution that includes managing outsourced vehicles, drivers, freight routing, IT integration, warehouse and\ndistribution management, as well as other logistics engineering services. SCS provides a wide range of services relating to a customer\u2019s distribution\noperations, from designing the distribution network to managing distribution facilities. Customers can more precisely align inbound and outbound\nshipments, synchronize returns with optimized fleet use and arrange backhauls to offset transportation costs and minimize empty miles that will directly\nhelp lowering GHG emissions. The SCS Transportation Management business offers services relating to all aspects of a customer\u2019s transportation\nnetwork. Ryder\u2019s transportation specialists provide shipment planning and execution, through a series of technological and web-based solutions.\nRyder published an updated Corporate Sustainability Report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards Core option with\ndetailed emissions and activity data (http:\/\/rydercsr.com). For the 2019 CDP response year, updates are provided to emission data (sections C6, C7\nand C8), but at the time of CDP publication, these were not fully audited. Ryder plans to resume full CDP reporting in 2020.","Company_id":"5eed2b474fe2bd337cd9ab6f","Name":"Ryder System"},"Scope 3":{"CO2":230126},"Scope 2":{"StartDate":"2018-01-01","CO2":118889,"EndDate":"2018-12-31","CO2 market based":117963},"ReportingStandard":"The Climate Registry","Source":"https:\/\/ryder.com\/-\/media\/ryder\/ryder-global\/about-us\/sustainability\/adarydersysteminccdpclimatechangequestionnaire201920190802145748.pdf"}}

Because of increased demand for vehicle efficiency and reliability, companies that own and manage their own fleet of vehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of preventative maintenance for their vehicles. In addition, several trends have been increasing the need for outsourcing: increased complexity and cost of buying and maintaining vehicles including technology, diagnostics, and training; labor issues including a shortage of qualified truck drivers and mechanics; as well as increased regulation \u2013 e.g. more expensive emission controls needed for EPA-compliant engines - and enforcement of safety requirements. Under the FMS Full Service Lease option, Ryder offers vehicle maintenance services, supplies and related equipment necessary for operating and maintaining lease vehicles. This applies to customers who want to manage their own freight, but are interested in outsourcing or upgrading their fleet\nmanagement needs without having to invest their own capital. Under the FMS Commercial Rental option, customers who need to supplement their fleet on a short-term basis are able to rent vehicles for a day, a week, a month, or on a multi-year rental contract. The Dedicated Transportation Service (DTS) option provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicate transportation solution in the\nUS. Customers directly manage their overall freight movement but Ryder provides the equipment, maintenance, and administrative services (including driver hiring, training, routing and scheduling, and fleet sizing) associated with maintaining the customer\u2019s private fleet. This combination of services allow us to provide high service levels and the most efficient routing to lower fuel costs due to less idle time and fewer empty miles. A key difference between Dedicated Transportation Services and Full Service Lease is Ryder provides the drivers for Dedicated. The SCS supply chain solution provides Distribution and Transportation Management services in North America and Asia. SCS customers are looking for a total integrated solution that includes managing outsourced vehicles, drivers, freight routing, IT integration, warehouse and distribution management, as well as other logistics engineering services. SCS provides a wide range of services relating to a customer\u2019s distribution operations, from designing the distribution network to managing distribution facilities. Customers can more precisely align inbound and outbound shipments, synchronize returns with optimized fleet use and arrange backhauls to offset transportation costs and minimize empty miles that will directly help lowering GHG emissions.

In its risk oversight role, the board reviews, evaluates and discusses with appropriate members of management whether the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate in identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating material risks facing the company. In addition, as reflected in our principles of business conduct, the board seeks to establish a \u201Ctone at the top\u201D communicating the board\u2019s strong commitment to ethical behavior and compliance with the law. While the board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight at the company, its committees assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to certain areas of risk. The Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) of the Board of Directors oversees the Company\u2019s sustainable development programs, including our approach to climate change. The CRC was composed of six Directors in 2013 and reports its activities on a regular basis to the full Board of Directors, including topics related to climate change.\nIn 2009 we established a multi-departmental Greenhouse Gas\/Energy Efficiency Task Force headed by our Vice President \u2013 Technology; our Vice President \u2013 Environmental Services and Sustainable Development provides advisory and management support. In 2012 we combined this task force with our Water Task Force (which focuses on water management). The Energy and Water Task Force addresses climate change topics , and evaluates associated potential business ramifications such as increased product demand, supply chain impacts, operational issues and opportunities (e.g., fuel sources, energy efficiency), and the effects of proposed legislation and new regulatory requirements. The Task Force meets regularly and provides updates of its work to senior management.\nCC1.2\nDo you provide incentives for the management of climate change issues, including the attainment of targets?\nYes\nCC1.2a\nPlease provide further details on the incentives provided for the management of climate change issues\nWho is entitled to benefit from these incentives?\nThe type of incentives Incentivized performance indicator\nAll employees Recognition (non-monetary) Freeport-McMoRan provides internal recognition through publishing short stories on our intranet system of individual employees or groups of employees whose activities further our energy efficiency.\nPage: CC2.

This tool allows us to identify key risks and opportunities across the environmental, social, and economic spectrum. To ensure the process is inclusive, we consider feedback from our stakeholder engagement processes, emerging regulations, industry best practice, and trends tracked by the media, nongovernmental organizations, and researchers. At the site level, each facility has a Sustainable Development Leader who facilitates an identification of risks and opportunities for that site. All the site-specific risks assessment and action plans are compiled into a company-wide SDRR. The corporate Risk Register is distributed to the company\u2019s Sustainable Development Leadership Team. The team is sponsored by our Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. A list of sustainability focus areas is also submitted to the Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors. In addition to the Risk Register, we have a multi-departmental Energy and Water Task Force that addresses climate change issues, energy utilization opportunities, and evaluates associated business ramifications. Risks and opportunities are also assessed at the site and corporate level through periodic meetings of environmental staff in the U.S. We are also a founding member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), a CEO-led organization focused on improving contributions to sustainable development, including climate change. Consequently our membership allows the identification of risks and opportunities at the industry-wide level. Our Project Development Sustainability Review process is used by our project teams to incorporate environmental, social and economic considerations into our development projects at the earliest stages (scoping or pre-feasibility).\nCC2.1c\nHow do you prioritize the risks and opportunities identified?\nThe Freeport-McMoRan Sustainable Development framework is designed for alignment with the ICMM Sustainable Development Framework and implemented based on site-specific factors and influences over the short to long-term. Our framework has evolved over the past five years and operations vary in maturity of its implementation. Essential to our framework is the Sustainable Development Risk Register process which prioritizes environmental, social and economic challenges and opportunities based on our views of potential impacts to the business and the importance of these topics to stakeholders. As part of this process, local management teams utilize a matrix with eight consequence categories including community or environmental aspects, and reputational and production impacts. In 2012, we updated our Sustainable Development Risk Register SOP to increase our level of confidence that we are identifying and addressing key issues for our business and our stakeholders, including an action plan summary format that documents key actions\/milestones with expected completion dates.\nCC2.2\nIs climate change integrated into your business strategy?\nYes\nCC2.2a\nPlease describe the process of how climate change is integrated into your business strategy and any outcomes of this process\nThe Sustainable Development Risk Register, developed as part of Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s sustainability program, is a formal management system for the identification of sustainability issues across all operations. This sustainability Risk Register allows us to identify key risks and opportunities across the environmental (including climate change related), social, and economic spectrum. As a result, the Risk Register is an influential force behind business decisions related to energy efficiency and climate change. As set forth in detail below, this process assists Freeport-McMoRan in developing goals and strategies for greenhouse gas emission reductions.\nThe Sustainable Development Risk Register is core to how Freeport-McMoRan will fulfill its obligations to implement ICMM\u2019s Climate Change Policy (we have this obligation as an ICMM member). All ICMM members have committed to (1) developing greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies and implementing economic emission reduction opportunities; (2) ensuring efficient use of natural resources; (3) supporting research and development of low greenhouse gas emission technologies that are appropriate to the industry; and (4) measuring progress and reporting results.\nThrough development of the corporate Sustainable Development Risk Register and creation of the multi-departmental Energy and Water Task Force, Freeport- McMoRan has determined that the two potential climate change aspects that could affect our operations are increased energy costs and long-term sustainable water availability. In response, there is a corporate-driven effort to evaluate energy efficiency opportunities associated with milling and solution extraction\/electrowinning which are the most significant power consuming processes at our facilities. Mining sites in water-stressed regions maintain water balance models to better understand water uses and to identify system losses (such as entrapment within tailings storage facilities) within the operation. Although the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, operations in water-stressed regions also conduct annual scenario planning to evaluate the potential impacts of hypothetical reductions of total water availability (physical or otherwise caused) and hypothetical extreme precipitation events. This program aims to help us plan to adapt operations to water shortage or extreme surplus time periods. As described below, we recognize the critical link between increased energy consumption associated with the implementation of sustainable large-scale water supply projects.\nThe components of Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s long term strategy are to monitor international legislative and regulatory developments pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards, greenhouse gas reduction schedules, reporting obligations, and to examine opportunities to increase consumption of renewable energy. Freeport-McMoRan will also actively evaluate the business ramifications of potential impacts to energy costs and the demand changes for copper or molybdenum. Furthermore, we continue to engage with energy management experts to discuss the potential for new overarching mining system practices that could be employed to considerably reduce the energy and greenhouse gas intensity of future projects. Subject to ore body characteristics, such step changes would also be predicated on technological innovation in material haulage and we are tracking this evolution closely. Freeport-McMoRan will champion site-specific projects, including considerations for third-party verification of reductions and achievement of the Freeport-McMoRan sustainability targets, that are within our span of control, such as renewable energy proposals relevant to our operations and\/or property holdings, energy efficiency opportunities, and mining equipment purchases or operational improvements (mine planning, fleet management, etc.) that reduce direct emissions. For example, we expect that milling technologies installed as we expand our facilities will deliver significant energy efficiency gains over older milling technology. Based on recent experience, Freeport-McMoRan achieves significant improvements in energy efficiency associated with new processing facilities (including milling technologies). However, these gains do not economically justify, even at a hypothetical $50\/ton carbon tax, the replacement of existing plants solely to improve energy efficiency.\nUtilization of the Sustainable Development Risk Register and Project Development Sustainability Review process (for new projects or expansions) allows us to proactively identify risks and opportunities related to climate change and energy efficiency at the pre-feasibility level and resolve those issues through feasibility studies into project design. Thus, we deal with these identified issues in a proactive manner rather than dealing with these issues in a reactive manner.\nFreeport-McMoRan is assessing the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the Pacific Ocean to treat saltwater for a potential expansion project at our El\nAbra facility located in the Atacama Desert, a water-stressed region, as part of the process to ensure long-term water supply for that project. Our major brownfield expansion project at Cerro Verde near Arequipa, Peru is also located in a water-stressed region. Water for our Cerro Verde mining operation in Peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation. Its existing tailings storage facility also is among the world\u2019s best in terms of water recovery. The operation is constructing a wastewater treatment plant for the city of Arequipa, Peru as it progresses its large-scale expansion, and has obtained authorization to reuse an annual average of one cubic meter per second of the treated water. The plant is expected to improve regional water quality in the Rio Chili, reduce waterborne illnesses and enhance the value of local agricultural products while providing water for an economically important operational expansion for the region.\nCC2.3\nDo you engage in activities that could either directly or indirectly influence public policy on climate change through any of the following?

The Task Force includes senior government relations personnel, meets regularly and provides updates of its work to senior management.\nThe purpose of the Corporate Responsibility Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling the Board\u2019s oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company\u2019s (1) environmental policy and implementation programs, (2) human rights policy and practices, (3) safety and health policies and programs, (4) community health programs and related public health and medical matters, (5) community policy and practices, governmental and stakeholder relations, and social investment and sustainable development programs, (6) charitable contributions and (7) political activity and spending practices.\nPage: CC3. Targets and Initiatives\nCC3.1\nDid you have an emissions reduction target that was active (ongoing or reached completion) in the reporting year?\nNo\nCC3.1e\nPlease explain (i) why you do not have a target; and (ii) forecast how your emissions will change over the next five years\nThe nature of our operations makes an emissions reduction target of the type requested by this questionnaire impractical, if not physically impossible. First, our direct and indirect emissions are directly related to changes in our mining production, which is correlated to global economic conditions. Consequently, changing market conditions, which are outside of our control, require adjustments to our mining rates. Through attractive brownfield expansion projects, including those at Cerro Verde, Morenci, and Tenke Fungurume Mining, we are targeting over 5 billion pounds annual copper production by 2015 (37% Increase from 2012). The Company is evaluating other project opportunities to increase product volumes which could be pursued over the next decade. Consequently, we expect total emissions to increase over this time period. As a result, we have been unable to formulate a realistic absolute or intensity target. We are, however, committed to continuous improvement in our carbon footprint and evaluating options as discussed below that could provide reductions in our emissions in the face of increasing production or physical factors that would otherwise increase emissions.\nA large proportion of our direct emissions are from the operation of haul trucks to move extracted ore to the processing facility. As an open pit matures, haul road length increases and haul trucks are required to move ore an additional distance to the processing facility. Additionally, when market conditions necessitate the\nmining and processing of lower grade ore, haul trucks must move more material. Our current business plans show increased fuel consumption caused by longer and steeper haulage. As such, without a change in applicable technology, which is unavailable at this time, our plans indicate increasing direct emissions (both total and intensity-based emissions) even without increased copper production. Even though business plans estimate an increase in these direct emissions, we are exploring possibilities to mitigate increased emissions from haul truck operation.\nWe are evaluating energy efficiency opportunities associated with milling and solution extraction\/electrowinning, which are the most significant power consuming processes at our facilities. Based on recent experience, Freeport-McMoRan achieves significant improvements in energy efficiency associated with new processing facilities (including milling technologies). However, these gains do not economically justify, even at a hypothetical $50\/ton carbon tax, the replacement of existing plants solely to improve energy efficiency. The breakeven point on this type of replacement would take multiple decades. Nevertheless, we do anticipate that our energy efficiency initiative will lead to a reduction in direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions compared with emissions had those steps not been taken, particularly with implementation of new processing technologies as our production output grows.\nCC3.2\nDoes the use of your goods and\/or services directly enable GHG emissions to be avoided by a third party?\nYes\nCC3.2a\nPlease provide details of how the use of your goods and\/or services directly enable GHG emissions to be avoided by a third party\nFreeport-McMoRan\u2019s products are used in technologies and infrastructure that may help alleviate climate change. Copper is a key component of renewable energy, transportation, power generation and telecommunications systems; it is used in plumbing, wiring, conductivity and connectivity. Molybdenum strengthens steel, resists heat and adds corrosion resistance to piping for water distribution systems and in solar cells. Cobalt is vital to alternative energy applications. These technologies include hybrid vehicles, wind turbines, high efficiency motors, and \u201Cgreen\u201D buildings. The following examples illustrate the importance of our products to technologies that may alleviate climate change.\n\u2022 Electric vehicles consume two to three times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine. Additionally, charging stations needed to fuel these vehicles will increase the size of the power grid. \u2022 Wind turbines consume four to five times the amount of copper per megawatt compared to carbon based power generation. Wind turbines range from 500kW to 7MW in size. \u2022 Solar power consumes incremental copper in terms of electrical grid extension and in small motors attached to each panel needed to follow the sun. \u2022 High efficiency motors consume up to 75% more copper than a standard motor. \u2022 Green buildings require additional meters and other electronics that are essential to optimizing energy use. Additionally, similar concepts will allow the national power grid to become \u201Csmart\u201D. \u2022 Cobalt is used in Lithium ion batteries needed to power hybrid\/electric vehicles and consumer electronics.\nCC3.3\nDid you have emissions reduction initiatives that were active within the reporting year (this can include those in the planning and implementation phases)\nYes\nCC3.3a\nPlease identify the total number of projects at each stage of development, and for those in the implementation stages, the estimated CO2e savings\nStage of development Number of projects Total estimated annual CO2e savings in metric tonnes CO2e (only for rows marked *) Under investigation 4 To be implemented* 0 0 Implementation commenced* 1 1150 Implemented* 7 14683 Not to be implemented 0 0\nCC3.3b\nFor those initiatives implemented in the reporting year, please provide details in the table below\nActivity type Description of activity\nEstimated annual CO2e\nsavings (metric tonnes CO2e)\nAnnual monetary savings\n(unit currency -\nas specified in CC0.4)\nInvestment required\n(unit currency - as specified in\nCC0.4)\nPayback period\nEstimated lifetime of\nthe initiative,\nyears\nComment\nEnergy efficiency: Processes\nFreeport-McMoRan\u2019s Henderson mine in Colorado installed a mill vacuum receiver.

Climate Change Risks\nCC5.1\nHave you identified any climate change risks that have the potential to generate a substantive change in your business operations, revenue or expenditure? Tick all that apply\nRisks driven by changes in regulation Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters Risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments\nCC5.1a\nPlease describe your risks driven by changes in regulation\nRisk driver Air pollution limits\nDescription\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions from new fossil fuel-fired power plants. The EPA plans to propose regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from modified and existing power plants in summer 2014. This suite of regulations could increase the cost of electricity production and the cost of purchased power. The magnitude of the impact is uncertain at this time and will depend upon EPA's approach.\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe 1 to 3 years\nDirect\/ Indirect Indirect (Supply chain)\nLikelihood Very likely Magnitude of impact Unknown\nEstimated financial implications\nCopper production is an electricity intensive operation and any regulations that increase the cost of electricity production could increase our operating costs. However, a hypothetical carbon tax of $50\/ton on greenhouse gas emissions (direct and indirect) from our operations in the Americas (based on 2012 data) results in an operating cost increase of less than 10% for U.S. sites. Based on expected future emissions, the associated increase in operating costs do not alter operating plan changes.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan is involved in state regulatory proceedings that are required to allocate the costs of these programs as implemented by regulated utilities. Furthermore, Freeport-McMoRan has developed agreements to purchase solar-produced electricity from the solar installation at our Bagdad, Arizona facility.\nRisk driver Air pollution limits\nCost of management\nFreeport-McMoRan has entered into leasing agreements for the installation of solar energy production at two of our properties. As the lessor, Freeport-McMoRan does not have any capital expenditures for these solar installations. Freeport-McMoRan has a fixed-price agreement to purchase electricity produced at the solar facility installed at our Bagdad, Arizona facility. There is no direct cost to Freeport-McMoRan to engage in the regulatory process.\nRisk driver Emission reporting obligations\nDescription\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated regulations requiring facilities in certain source categories whose emissions exceed threshold levels to report their greenhouse gas emissions. Freeport- McMoRan has four facilities that are required to report emissions pursuant to this program (the smelting operation in Miami, Arizona; the refinery and rod mill in El Paso, Texas; and the mines in Morenci, Arizona and Chino, New Mexico).\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe Up to 1 year\nDirect\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood Virtually certain Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications The EPA\u2019s mandatory reporting rule requires facilities to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions. The primary financial implications have been the development of internal procedures to monitor, track, and calculate these emissions.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan has developed procedures for the calculation and reporting of greenhouse gases.\nCost of management The only costs incurred by Freeport-McMoRan have been internal costs to develop a process to calculate these emissions and internally verify them.\nRisk driver Emission reporting obligations\nDescription New Mexico has promulgated regulations requiring sources in certain categories to report their greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, Freeport-McMoRan's New Mexico operations are subject to these reporting requirements. Potential impact Increased operational cost\nTimeframe Up to 1 year Direct\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood Virtually certain Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications New Mexico requires greenhouse gas reporting for categories of sources. As a result, Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s New Mexico operations are subject to this requirement. The primary financial implications have been the development\nRisk driver Emission reporting obligations of internal procedures to monitor, track, and calculate these emissions.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan has developed procedures for the calculation and reporting of greenhouse gases.\nCost of management The only costs incurred by Freeport-McMoRan have been internal costs to develop a process to calculate these emissions and internally verify them.\nRisk driver General environmental regulations, including planning\nDescription The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has begun promulgating regulations for certain source categories that emit greenhouse gases. As the U.S. EPA continues to regulate more sources of greenhouse gases, the price of raw materials and other products may increase.\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe Unknown\nDirect\/ Indirect Indirect (Supply chain)\nLikelihood About as likely as not Magnitude of impact Unknown\nEstimated financial implications\nEPA has begun regulating new major sources of greenhouse gases and major modifications to major sources of greenhouse gases. It is unclear how these regulatory programs will affect the U.S. economy but they could result in an increase in the cost of domestic products. In addition, new permitting requirements for new major sources and major modifications to major sources of greenhouse gasses may increase costs, uncertainty, and timing associated with permitting at our major source facilities.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan engages policymakers through our participation in International Council on Mining and Metals and the Business Roundtable.\nCost of management Costs are reflected in membership dues to these organizations and staff time to participate in the organizations' activities.\nRisk driver Cap and trade schemes\nDescription Freeport-McMoRan's Atlantic Copper smelter in Spain is subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. Potential impact Increased operational cost\nTimeframe Up to 1 year Direct\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood Virtually certain Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s smelter operation in Spain must obtain emission allowances for its greenhouse gas emissions.\nRisk driver Cap and trade schemes\nManagement method Under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, Atlantic Copper obtains free allowances that cover its allowance obligations. Cost of management At this time, there is no cost to Atlantic Copper because its emissions do not exceed its allowance allocation.\nCC5.1b\nPlease describe your risks that are driven by change in physical climate parameters\nRisk driver Change in precipitation extremes and droughts\nDescription The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances. Water is a necessary component in milling copper ore. As a result, any limitation in water availability could affect operations.\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe 1 to 3 years\nDirect\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood More likely than not Magnitude of impact Medium-high\nEstimated financial implications\nOur operations have sufficient water rights and claims to cover current operational demands. We cannot predict, however, the outcome of pending or future legal proceedings. The loss of some or all water rights or shortages of water could require curtailing or closing production and could prevent expansion opportunities. Providing a quantitative value is purely speculative and would vary depending upon the site affected, the magnitude of water lost, and the cost of finding replacement water.\nManagement method\nFreeport-McMoRan acts proactively to protect its water rights and to evaluate water supply and water quality for existing and possible future requirements, including development of new water sources. In North America, under state law, our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location. In Arizona, Freeport-McMoRan is a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the State of Arizona is quantifying and prioritizing surface water claims for two of the state\u2019s largest river systems that affect four of our mines (Morenci, Sierrita, Miami, and Safford). The precedent in this case may also affect our mine in Bagdad, Arizona. In Colorado, our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and Freeport-McMoRan is involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights. Freeport-McMoRan has initiated a company-wide program that requires improved metering, water balance modeling and prioritization of water management practices, including the implementation of water management plans. All major operations in water stressed regions now maintain a water balance model. In collaboration with communities and host governments we are also working on long-term water supply projects to facilitate co-existence of mining and community development and reduce the likelihood of water resources becoming a conflict driver.\nRisk driver Change in precipitation extremes and droughts\nCost of management The water supply projects that we have and will continue to pursue are capital intensive and most have substantial operating and maintenance costs. With long-lived reserves and a portfolio of brownfield expansion projects, these costs are economically justified particularly when factoring the mutual benefit to communities in regions where we operate.\nCC5.1c\nPlease describe your risks that are driven by changes in other climate-related developments\nRisk driver Reputation\nDescription Climate change is a common topic of interest and debate for some governments, private sector participants, socially responsible investors, and academia. Freeport-McMoRan may face reputational related repercussions if stakeholders determine the company has not adequately addressed climate change issues.\nPotential impact Reduced stock price (market valuation) Timeframe Unknown\nDirect\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood About as likely as not Magnitude of impact Unknown\nEstimated financial implications Inaction on climate change could result in stakeholders refusing involvement with or investment in Freeport-McMoRan. However, it is impossible to quantify the financial impact on the company.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan annually participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project and publishes its Working Toward Sustainable Development report that sets forth Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s sustainability policies and actions, including those related to climate change and energy efficiency. Consequently, Freeport-McMoRan attempts to be transparent in its actions associated with climate change.\nCost of management The only costs associated with these actions are internal Freeport-McMoRan costs, such as preparation of the annual Working Toward Sustainable Development document and costs associated in meeting with socially responsible investors.\nPage: CC6. Climate Change Opportunities\nCC6.1\nHave you identified any climate change opportunities that have the potential to generate a substantive change in your business operations, revenue or expenditure? Tick all that apply\nOpportunities driven by changes in regulation Opportunities driven by changes in other climate-related developments\nCC6.1a\nPlease describe your opportunities that are driven by changes in regulation\nOpportunity driver Renewable energy regulation\nDescription\nSeveral U.S. states have instituted short- and long-term goals for the use of renewable energy sources by power providers. Also, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions from new fossil fuel-fired power plants. In 2014, EPA plans to propose regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from modified and existing power plants. This suite of regulations could increase the cost of electricity production at these sources. These policies may increase the value of electricity generated from solar operations. Freeport-McMoRan has been actively engaged in utilizing its substantial property holdings for solar electricity production facilities.\nPotential impact Premium price opportunities Timeframe 1 to 3 years\nDirect\/ Indirect Indirect (Supply chain)\nLikelihood More likely than not Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications\nWe have two types of partnerships with solar companies and power providers for the installation of solar facilities. In transactions like those in Ajo, Arizona, we are only the land lessor. The power generated goes to the provider and the financial impact arises from the lease agreement. In transactions like those in Bagdad, Arizona, we are the lessor and have entered into an agreement to purchase the power generated at a fixed rate. Any savings depends upon the relative future electricity cost.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan is actively engaged with solar energy developers to determine whether solar power projects may prove beneficial on any of Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s property. Freeport-McMoRan is also engaged in a University of Arizona pilot project to determine whether solar energy systems may be installed on inactive tailings areas.\nCost of management As the lessor of land for these projects, Freeport-McMoRan does not incur any costs associated with their implementation.\nOpportunity driver Product efficiency regulations and standards\nDescription\nFreeport-McMoRan\u2019s products are used in technologies and infrastructure that may help alleviate climate change.

Generally, Freeport-McMoRan operates mining operations, copper smelters, molybdenum conversion facilities, and copper rod plants. As a result, Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s primary products require processing before they are used by the ultimate consumer or are incorporated into products. Freeport-McMoRan analyzed whether changes in physical climate parameters such as temperature or precipitation (either extremes or on average) may present opportunities in our business operations. Changes in physical climate parameters did not present any direct opportunity for Freeport-McMoRan. Furthermore, Freeport-McMoRan has not been able to identify any downstream products that respond to changes in physical climate parameters (i.e., temperature or precipitation) that may increase in sales of copper or other metals.\nModule: GHG Emissions Accounting, Energy and Fuel Use, and Trading\nPage: CC7.

Due to the great distance travelled to deliver this product, Freeport-McMoRan believes this to be a significant portion of its Scope 3 emissions. Emission factor used is from IPCC SAR Road Transport and result is rounded to 2 significant digits. (2) ground transportation of copper \"concentrate\" (i.e. the product of milling copper ore) and copper anodes (copper product from the smelter) within the U.S. Emission factor used is from IPCC SAR Road Transport and the result is rounded to 2 significant digits.\nProcessing of sold products\nRelevant, calculated 313200\nBecause Freeport-McMoRan is an integrated and diverse company, many downstream processing emissions that would be considered Scope 3 emissions for other companies are Scope 1 emissions for Freeport-McMoRan. For example, the majority of copper concentrate product produced at Freeport-McMoRan mines is smelted by Freeport-McMoRan-owned smelters and the majority of copper anodes produced by the smelter are processed in Freeport-McMoRan owned Refineries. However, some concentrate and anodes are sold to third parties for smelting. The emissions reported here only represent emissions from the smelting of concentrate and the refining of copper anodes sold to third parties. Emissions were calculated by applying the average emissions at Freeport-McMoRan smelters and refinery to the amount of concentrate and anodes sold to third parties. The result was rounded to 2 significant digits.\nUse of sold products\nNot relevant, explanation provided\nAs a producer of commodities, all products produced by Freeport- McMoRan require further processing for use.

In addition, as reflected in our principles of business conduct, the board seeks to establish a \u201Ctone at the top\u201D communicating the board\u2019s strong commitment to ethical behavior and compliance with the law. While the board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight at the company, its committees assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to certain areas of risk. The Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) of the Board of Directors oversees the Company\u2019s sustainable development programs, including our approach to climate change. The CRC was composed of six Directors in 2013 and reports its activities on a regular basis to the full Board of Directors, including topics related to climate change.\nIn 2009 we established a multi-departmental Greenhouse Gas\/Energy Efficiency Task Force headed by our Vice President \u2013 Technology; our Vice President \u2013 Environmental Services and Sustainable Development provides advisory and management support. In 2012 we combined this task force with our Water Task Force (which focuses on water management). The Energy and Water Task Force addresses climate change topics , and evaluates associated potential business ramifications such as increased product demand, supply chain impacts, operational issues and opportunities (e.g., fuel sources, energy efficiency), and the effects of proposed legislation and new regulatory requirements. The Task Force meets regularly and provides updates of its work to senior management.\nCC1.2\nDo you provide incentives for the management of climate change issues, including the attainment of targets?\nYes\nCC1.2a\nPlease provide further details on the incentives provided for the management of climate change issues\nWho is entitled to benefit from these incentives?\nThe type of incentives Incentivized performance indicator\nAll employees Recognition (non-monetary) Freeport-McMoRan provides internal recognition through publishing short stories on our intranet system of individual employees or groups of employees whose activities further our energy efficiency.\nPage: CC2.

This tool allows us to identify key risks and opportunities across the environmental, social, and economic spectrum. To ensure the process is inclusive, we consider feedback from our stakeholder engagement processes, emerging regulations, industry best practice, and trends tracked by the media, nongovernmental organizations, and researchers. At the site level, each facility has a Sustainable Development Leader who facilitates an identification of risks and opportunities for that site. All the site-specific risks assessment and action plans are compiled into a company-wide SDRR. The corporate Risk Register is distributed to the company\u2019s Sustainable Development Leadership Team. The team is sponsored by our Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. A list of sustainability focus areas is also submitted to the Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors. In addition to the Risk Register, we have a multi-departmental Energy and Water Task Force that addresses climate change issues, energy utilization opportunities, and evaluates associated business ramifications. Risks and opportunities are also assessed at the site and corporate level through periodic meetings of environmental staff in the U.S. We are also a founding member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), a CEO-led organization focused on improving contributions to sustainable development, including climate change. Consequently our membership allows the identification of risks and opportunities at the industry-wide level. Our Project Development Sustainability Review process is used by our project teams to incorporate environmental, social and economic considerations into our development projects at the earliest stages (scoping or pre-feasibility).\nCC2.1c\nHow do you prioritize the risks and opportunities identified?\nThe Freeport-McMoRan Sustainable Development framework is designed for alignment with the ICMM Sustainable Development Framework and implemented based on site-specific factors and influences over the short to long-term. Our framework has evolved over the past five years and operations vary in maturity of its implementation. Essential to our framework is the Sustainable Development Risk Register process which prioritizes environmental, social and economic challenges and opportunities based on our views of potential impacts to the business and the importance of these topics to stakeholders. As part of this process, local management teams utilize a matrix with eight consequence categories including community or environmental aspects, and reputational and production impacts. In 2012, we updated our Sustainable Development Risk Register SOP to increase our level of confidence that we are identifying and addressing key issues for our business and our stakeholders, including an action plan summary format that documents key actions\/milestones with expected completion dates.\nCC2.2\nIs climate change integrated into your business strategy?\nYes\nCC2.2a\nPlease describe the process of how climate change is integrated into your business strategy and any outcomes of this process\nThe Sustainable Development Risk Register, developed as part of Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s sustainability program, is a formal management system for the identification of sustainability issues across all operations. This sustainability Risk Register allows us to identify key risks and opportunities across the environmental (including climate change related), social, and economic spectrum. As a result, the Risk Register is an influential force behind business decisions related to energy efficiency and climate change. As set forth in detail below, this process assists Freeport-McMoRan in developing goals and strategies for greenhouse gas emission reductions.\nThe Sustainable Development Risk Register is core to how Freeport-McMoRan will fulfill its obligations to implement ICMM\u2019s Climate Change Policy (we have this obligation as an ICMM member). All ICMM members have committed to (1) developing greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies and implementing economic emission reduction opportunities; (2) ensuring efficient use of natural resources; (3) supporting research and development of low greenhouse gas emission technologies that are appropriate to the industry; and (4) measuring progress and reporting results.\nThrough development of the corporate Sustainable Development Risk Register and creation of the multi-departmental Energy and Water Task Force, Freeport- McMoRan has determined that the two potential climate change aspects that could affect our operations are increased energy costs and long-term sustainable water availability. In response, there is a corporate-driven effort to evaluate energy efficiency opportunities associated with milling and solution extraction\/electrowinning which are the most significant power consuming processes at our facilities. Mining sites in water-stressed regions maintain water balance models to better understand water uses and to identify system losses (such as entrapment within tailings storage facilities) within the operation. Although the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, operations in water-stressed regions also conduct annual scenario planning to evaluate the potential impacts of hypothetical reductions of total water availability (physical or otherwise caused) and hypothetical extreme precipitation events. This program aims to help us plan to adapt operations to water shortage or extreme surplus time periods. As described below, we recognize the critical link between increased energy consumption associated with the implementation of sustainable large-scale water supply projects.\nThe components of Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s long term strategy are to monitor international legislative and regulatory developments pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards, greenhouse gas reduction schedules, reporting obligations, and to examine opportunities to increase consumption of renewable energy. Freeport-McMoRan will also actively evaluate the business ramifications of potential impacts to energy costs and the demand changes for copper or molybdenum. Furthermore, we continue to engage with energy management experts to discuss the potential for new overarching mining system practices that could be employed to considerably reduce the energy and greenhouse gas intensity of future projects. Subject to ore body characteristics, such step changes would also be predicated on technological innovation in material haulage and we are tracking this evolution closely. Freeport-McMoRan will champion site-specific projects, including considerations for third-party verification of reductions and achievement of the Freeport-McMoRan sustainability targets, that are within our span of control, such as renewable energy proposals relevant to our operations and\/or property holdings, energy efficiency opportunities, and mining equipment purchases or operational improvements (mine planning, fleet management, etc.) that reduce direct emissions. For example, we expect that milling technologies installed as we expand our facilities will deliver significant energy efficiency gains over older milling technology. Based on recent experience, Freeport-McMoRan achieves significant improvements in energy efficiency associated with new processing facilities (including milling technologies). However, these gains do not economically justify, even at a hypothetical $50\/ton carbon tax, the replacement of existing plants solely to improve energy efficiency.\nUtilization of the Sustainable Development Risk Register and Project Development Sustainability Review process (for new projects or expansions) allows us to proactively identify risks and opportunities related to climate change and energy efficiency at the pre-feasibility level and resolve those issues through feasibility studies into project design. Thus, we deal with these identified issues in a proactive manner rather than dealing with these issues in a reactive manner.\nFreeport-McMoRan is assessing the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the Pacific Ocean to treat saltwater for a potential expansion project at our El\nAbra facility located in the Atacama Desert, a water-stressed region, as part of the process to ensure long-term water supply for that project. Our major brownfield expansion project at Cerro Verde near Arequipa, Peru is also located in a water-stressed region. Water for our Cerro Verde mining operation in Peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation. Its existing tailings storage facility also is among the world\u2019s best in terms of water recovery. The operation is constructing a wastewater treatment plant for the city of Arequipa, Peru as it progresses its large-scale expansion, and has obtained authorization to reuse an annual average of one cubic meter per second of the treated water. The plant is expected to improve regional water quality in the Rio Chili, reduce waterborne illnesses and enhance the value of local agricultural products while providing water for an economically important operational expansion for the region.\nCC2.3\nDo you engage in activities that could either directly or indirectly influence public policy on climate change through any of the following?

The Task Force includes senior government relations personnel, meets regularly and provides updates of its work to senior management.\nThe purpose of the Corporate Responsibility Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling the Board\u2019s oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company\u2019s (1) environmental policy and implementation programs, (2) human rights policy and practices, (3) safety and health policies and programs, (4) community health programs and related public health and medical matters, (5) community policy and practices, governmental and stakeholder relations, and social investment and sustainable development programs, (6) charitable contributions and (7) political activity and spending practices.\nPage: CC3. Targets and Initiatives\nCC3.1\nDid you have an emissions reduction target that was active (ongoing or reached completion) in the reporting year?\nNo\nCC3.1e\nPlease explain (i) why you do not have a target; and (ii) forecast how your emissions will change over the next five years\nThe nature of our operations makes an emissions reduction target of the type requested by this questionnaire impractical, if not physically impossible. First, our direct and indirect emissions are directly related to changes in our mining production, which is correlated to global economic conditions. Consequently, changing market conditions, which are outside of our control, require adjustments to our mining rates. Through attractive brownfield expansion projects, including those at Cerro Verde, Morenci, and Tenke Fungurume Mining, we are targeting over 5 billion pounds annual copper production by 2015 (37% Increase from 2012). The Company is evaluating other project opportunities to increase product volumes which could be pursued over the next decade. Consequently, we expect total emissions to increase over this time period. As a result, we have been unable to formulate a realistic absolute or intensity target. We are, however, committed to continuous improvement in our carbon footprint and evaluating options as discussed below that could provide reductions in our emissions in the face of increasing production or physical factors that would otherwise increase emissions.\nA large proportion of our direct emissions are from the operation of haul trucks to move extracted ore to the processing facility. As an open pit matures, haul road length increases and haul trucks are required to move ore an additional distance to the processing facility. Additionally, when market conditions necessitate the\nmining and processing of lower grade ore, haul trucks must move more material. Our current business plans show increased fuel consumption caused by longer and steeper haulage. As such, without a change in applicable technology, which is unavailable at this time, our plans indicate increasing direct emissions (both total and intensity-based emissions) even without increased copper production. Even though business plans estimate an increase in these direct emissions, we are exploring possibilities to mitigate increased emissions from haul truck operation.\nWe are evaluating energy efficiency opportunities associated with milling and solution extraction\/electrowinning, which are the most significant power consuming processes at our facilities. Based on recent experience, Freeport-McMoRan achieves significant improvements in energy efficiency associated with new processing facilities (including milling technologies). However, these gains do not economically justify, even at a hypothetical $50\/ton carbon tax, the replacement of existing plants solely to improve energy efficiency. The breakeven point on this type of replacement would take multiple decades. Nevertheless, we do anticipate that our energy efficiency initiative will lead to a reduction in direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions compared with emissions had those steps not been taken, particularly with implementation of new processing technologies as our production output grows.\nCC3.2\nDoes the use of your goods and\/or services directly enable GHG emissions to be avoided by a third party?\nYes\nCC3.2a\nPlease provide details of how the use of your goods and\/or services directly enable GHG emissions to be avoided by a third party\nFreeport-McMoRan\u2019s products are used in technologies and infrastructure that may help alleviate climate change. Copper is a key component of renewable energy, transportation, power generation and telecommunications systems; it is used in plumbing, wiring, conductivity and connectivity. Molybdenum strengthens steel, resists heat and adds corrosion resistance to piping for water distribution systems and in solar cells. Cobalt is vital to alternative energy applications. These technologies include hybrid vehicles, wind turbines, high efficiency motors, and \u201Cgreen\u201D buildings. The following examples illustrate the importance of our products to technologies that may alleviate climate change.\n\u2022 Electric vehicles consume two to three times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine. Additionally, charging stations needed to fuel these vehicles will increase the size of the power grid. \u2022 Wind turbines consume four to five times the amount of copper per megawatt compared to carbon based power generation. Wind turbines range from 500kW to 7MW in size. \u2022 Solar power consumes incremental copper in terms of electrical grid extension and in small motors attached to each panel needed to follow the sun. \u2022 High efficiency motors consume up to 75% more copper than a standard motor. \u2022 Green buildings require additional meters and other electronics that are essential to optimizing energy use. Additionally, similar concepts will allow the national power grid to become \u201Csmart\u201D. \u2022 Cobalt is used in Lithium ion batteries needed to power hybrid\/electric vehicles and consumer electronics.\nCC3.3\nDid you have emissions reduction initiatives that were active within the reporting year (this can include those in the planning and implementation phases)\nYes\nCC3.3a\nPlease identify the total number of projects at each stage of development, and for those in the implementation stages, the estimated CO2e savings\nStage of development Number of projects Total estimated annual CO2e savings in metric tonnes CO2e (only for rows marked *) Under investigation 4 To be implemented* 0 0 Implementation commenced* 1 1150 Implemented* 7 14683 Not to be implemented 0 0\nCC3.3b\nFor those initiatives implemented in the reporting year, please provide details in the table below\nActivity type Description of activity\nEstimated annual CO2e\nsavings (metric tonnes CO2e)\nAnnual monetary savings\n(unit currency -\nas specified in CC0.4)\nInvestment required\n(unit currency - as specified in\nCC0.4)\nPayback period\nEstimated lifetime of\nthe initiative,\nyears\nComment\nEnergy efficiency: Processes\nFreeport-McMoRan\u2019s Henderson mine in Colorado installed a mill vacuum receiver.

Climate Change Risks\nCC5.1\nHave you identified any climate change risks that have the potential to generate a substantive change in your business operations, revenue or expenditure? Tick all that apply\nRisks driven by changes in regulation Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters Risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments\nCC5.1a\nPlease describe your risks driven by changes in regulation\nRisk driver Air pollution limits\nDescription\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions from new fossil fuel-fired power plants. The EPA plans to propose regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from modified and existing power plants in summer 2014. This suite of regulations could increase the cost of electricity production and the cost of purchased power. The magnitude of the impact is uncertain at this time and will depend upon EPA's approach.\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe 1 to 3 years\nDirect\/ Indirect Indirect (Supply chain)\nLikelihood Very likely Magnitude of impact Unknown\nEstimated financial implications\nCopper production is an electricity intensive operation and any regulations that increase the cost of electricity production could increase our operating costs. However, a hypothetical carbon tax of $50\/ton on greenhouse gas emissions (direct and indirect) from our operations in the Americas (based on 2012 data) results in an operating cost increase of less than 10% for U.S. sites. Based on expected future emissions, the associated increase in operating costs do not alter operating plan changes.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan is involved in state regulatory proceedings that are required to allocate the costs of these programs as implemented by regulated utilities. Furthermore, Freeport-McMoRan has developed agreements to purchase solar-produced electricity from the solar installation at our Bagdad, Arizona facility.\nRisk driver Air pollution limits\nCost of management\nFreeport-McMoRan has entered into leasing agreements for the installation of solar energy production at two of our properties. As the lessor, Freeport-McMoRan does not have any capital expenditures for these solar installations. Freeport-McMoRan has a fixed-price agreement to purchase electricity produced at the solar facility installed at our Bagdad, Arizona facility. There is no direct cost to Freeport-McMoRan to engage in the regulatory process.\nRisk driver Emission reporting obligations\nDescription\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated regulations requiring facilities in certain source categories whose emissions exceed threshold levels to report their greenhouse gas emissions. Freeport- McMoRan has four facilities that are required to report emissions pursuant to this program (the smelting operation in Miami, Arizona; the refinery and rod mill in El Paso, Texas; and the mines in Morenci, Arizona and Chino, New Mexico).\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe Up to 1 year\nDirect\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood Virtually certain Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications The EPA\u2019s mandatory reporting rule requires facilities to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions. The primary financial implications have been the development of internal procedures to monitor, track, and calculate these emissions.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan has developed procedures for the calculation and reporting of greenhouse gases.\nCost of management The only costs incurred by Freeport-McMoRan have been internal costs to develop a process to calculate these emissions and internally verify them.\nRisk driver Emission reporting obligations\nDescription New Mexico has promulgated regulations requiring sources in certain categories to report their greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, Freeport-McMoRan's New Mexico operations are subject to these reporting requirements. Potential impact Increased operational cost\nTimeframe Up to 1 year Direct\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood Virtually certain Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications New Mexico requires greenhouse gas reporting for categories of sources. As a result, Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s New Mexico operations are subject to this requirement. The primary financial implications have been the development\nRisk driver Emission reporting obligations of internal procedures to monitor, track, and calculate these emissions.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan has developed procedures for the calculation and reporting of greenhouse gases.\nCost of management The only costs incurred by Freeport-McMoRan have been internal costs to develop a process to calculate these emissions and internally verify them.\nRisk driver General environmental regulations, including planning\nDescription The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has begun promulgating regulations for certain source categories that emit greenhouse gases. As the U.S. EPA continues to regulate more sources of greenhouse gases, the price of raw materials and other products may increase.\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe Unknown\nDirect\/ Indirect Indirect (Supply chain)\nLikelihood About as likely as not Magnitude of impact Unknown\nEstimated financial implications\nEPA has begun regulating new major sources of greenhouse gases and major modifications to major sources of greenhouse gases. It is unclear how these regulatory programs will affect the U.S. economy but they could result in an increase in the cost of domestic products. In addition, new permitting requirements for new major sources and major modifications to major sources of greenhouse gasses may increase costs, uncertainty, and timing associated with permitting at our major source facilities.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan engages policymakers through our participation in International Council on Mining and Metals and the Business Roundtable.\nCost of management Costs are reflected in membership dues to these organizations and staff time to participate in the organizations' activities.\nRisk driver Cap and trade schemes\nDescription Freeport-McMoRan's Atlantic Copper smelter in Spain is subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. Potential impact Increased operational cost\nTimeframe Up to 1 year Direct\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood Virtually certain Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s smelter operation in Spain must obtain emission allowances for its greenhouse gas emissions.\nRisk driver Cap and trade schemes\nManagement method Under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, Atlantic Copper obtains free allowances that cover its allowance obligations. Cost of management At this time, there is no cost to Atlantic Copper because its emissions do not exceed its allowance allocation.\nCC5.1b\nPlease describe your risks that are driven by change in physical climate parameters\nRisk driver Change in precipitation extremes and droughts\nDescription The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances. Water is a necessary component in milling copper ore. As a result, any limitation in water availability could affect operations.\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe 1 to 3 years\nDirect\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood More likely than not Magnitude of impact Medium-high\nEstimated financial implications\nOur operations have sufficient water rights and claims to cover current operational demands. We cannot predict, however, the outcome of pending or future legal proceedings. The loss of some or all water rights or shortages of water could require curtailing or closing production and could prevent expansion opportunities. Providing a quantitative value is purely speculative and would vary depending upon the site affected, the magnitude of water lost, and the cost of finding replacement water.\nManagement method\nFreeport-McMoRan acts proactively to protect its water rights and to evaluate water supply and water quality for existing and possible future requirements, including development of new water sources. In North America, under state law, our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location. In Arizona, Freeport-McMoRan is a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the State of Arizona is quantifying and prioritizing surface water claims for two of the state\u2019s largest river systems that affect four of our mines (Morenci, Sierrita, Miami, and Safford). The precedent in this case may also affect our mine in Bagdad, Arizona. In Colorado, our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and Freeport-McMoRan is involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights. Freeport-McMoRan has initiated a company-wide program that requires improved metering, water balance modeling and prioritization of water management practices, including the implementation of water management plans. All major operations in water stressed regions now maintain a water balance model. In collaboration with communities and host governments we are also working on long-term water supply projects to facilitate co-existence of mining and community development and reduce the likelihood of water resources becoming a conflict driver.\nRisk driver Change in precipitation extremes and droughts\nCost of management The water supply projects that we have and will continue to pursue are capital intensive and most have substantial operating and maintenance costs. With long-lived reserves and a portfolio of brownfield expansion projects, these costs are economically justified particularly when factoring the mutual benefit to communities in regions where we operate.\nCC5.1c\nPlease describe your risks that are driven by changes in other climate-related developments\nRisk driver Reputation\nDescription Climate change is a common topic of interest and debate for some governments, private sector participants, socially responsible investors, and academia. Freeport-McMoRan may face reputational related repercussions if stakeholders determine the company has not adequately addressed climate change issues.\nPotential impact Reduced stock price (market valuation) Timeframe Unknown\nDirect\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood About as likely as not Magnitude of impact Unknown\nEstimated financial implications Inaction on climate change could result in stakeholders refusing involvement with or investment in Freeport-McMoRan. However, it is impossible to quantify the financial impact on the company.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan annually participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project and publishes its Working Toward Sustainable Development report that sets forth Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s sustainability policies and actions, including those related to climate change and energy efficiency. Consequently, Freeport-McMoRan attempts to be transparent in its actions associated with climate change.\nCost of management The only costs associated with these actions are internal Freeport-McMoRan costs, such as preparation of the annual Working Toward Sustainable Development document and costs associated in meeting with socially responsible investors.\nPage: CC6. Climate Change Opportunities\nCC6.1\nHave you identified any climate change opportunities that have the potential to generate a substantive change in your business operations, revenue or expenditure? Tick all that apply\nOpportunities driven by changes in regulation Opportunities driven by changes in other climate-related developments\nCC6.1a\nPlease describe your opportunities that are driven by changes in regulation\nOpportunity driver Renewable energy regulation\nDescription\nSeveral U.S. states have instituted short- and long-term goals for the use of renewable energy sources by power providers. Also, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions from new fossil fuel-fired power plants. In 2014, EPA plans to propose regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from modified and existing power plants. This suite of regulations could increase the cost of electricity production at these sources. These policies may increase the value of electricity generated from solar operations. Freeport-McMoRan has been actively engaged in utilizing its substantial property holdings for solar electricity production facilities.\nPotential impact Premium price opportunities Timeframe 1 to 3 years\nDirect\/ Indirect Indirect (Supply chain)\nLikelihood More likely than not Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications\nWe have two types of partnerships with solar companies and power providers for the installation of solar facilities. In transactions like those in Ajo, Arizona, we are only the land lessor. The power generated goes to the provider and the financial impact arises from the lease agreement. In transactions like those in Bagdad, Arizona, we are the lessor and have entered into an agreement to purchase the power generated at a fixed rate. Any savings depends upon the relative future electricity cost.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan is actively engaged with solar energy developers to determine whether solar power projects may prove beneficial on any of Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s property. Freeport-McMoRan is also engaged in a University of Arizona pilot project to determine whether solar energy systems may be installed on inactive tailings areas.\nCost of management As the lessor of land for these projects, Freeport-McMoRan does not incur any costs associated with their implementation.\nOpportunity driver Product efficiency regulations and standards\nDescription\nFreeport-McMoRan\u2019s products are used in technologies and infrastructure that may help alleviate climate change. Copper is a key component of renewable energy, transportation, power generation and telecommunications systems; it is used in plumbing, wiring, conductivity and connectivity. Molybdenum strengthens steel, resists heat and adds corrosion resistance to piping for water distribution systems and in solar cells. Cobalt is vital to alternative energy applications. Thus, regulations requiring increased efficiency to slow or halt predicted climate change could potentially increase the demand for these products. These technologies include hybrid vehicles, wind turbines, high efficiency motors, and \u201Cgreen\u201D buildings.

Copper is a key component of renewable energy, transportation, power generation and telecommunications systems; it is used in plumbing, wiring, conductivity and connectivity. Molybdenum strengthens steel, resists heat and adds corrosion resistance to piping for water distribution systems and in solar cells. Cobalt is vital to alternative energy applications. Thus, changing consumer behaviour could potentially increase the demand for these products. These technologies include hybrid vehicles, wind turbines, high efficiency motors, and \u201Cgreen\u201D buildings.

Generally, Freeport-McMoRan operates mining operations, copper smelters, molybdenum conversion facilities, and copper rod plants. As a result, Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s primary products require processing before they are used by the ultimate consumer or are incorporated into products. Freeport-McMoRan analyzed whether changes in physical climate parameters such as temperature or precipitation (either extremes or on average) may present opportunities in our business operations. Changes in physical climate parameters did not present any direct opportunity for Freeport-McMoRan. Furthermore, Freeport-McMoRan has not been able to identify any downstream products that respond to changes in physical climate parameters (i.e., temperature or precipitation) that may increase in sales of copper or other metals.\nModule: GHG Emissions Accounting, Energy and Fuel Use, and Trading\nPage: CC7.

Due to the great distance travelled to deliver this product, Freeport-McMoRan believes this to be a significant portion of its Scope 3 emissions. Emission factor used is from IPCC SAR Road Transport and result is rounded to 2 significant digits. (2) ground transportation of copper \"concentrate\" (i.e. the product of milling copper ore) and copper anodes (copper product from the smelter) within the U.S. Emission factor used is from IPCC SAR Road Transport and the result is rounded to 2 significant digits.\nProcessing of sold products\nRelevant, calculated 313200\nBecause Freeport-McMoRan is an integrated and diverse company, many downstream processing emissions that would be considered Scope 3 emissions for other companies are Scope 1 emissions for Freeport-McMoRan. For example, the majority of copper concentrate product produced at Freeport-McMoRan mines is smelted by Freeport-McMoRan-owned smelters and the majority of copper anodes produced by the smelter are processed in Freeport-McMoRan owned Refineries. However, some concentrate and anodes are sold to third parties for smelting. The emissions reported here only represent emissions from the smelting of concentrate and the refining of copper anodes sold to third parties. Emissions were calculated by applying the average emissions at Freeport-McMoRan smelters and refinery to the amount of concentrate and anodes sold to third parties. The result was rounded to 2 significant digits.\nUse of sold products\nNot relevant, explanation provided\nAs a producer of commodities, all products produced by Freeport- McMoRan require further processing for use.

Freeport-McMoRan is the world's largest publicly traded copper producer.\nFreeport-McMoRan's portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits; significant mining operations in the Americas, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in North America and the Cerro Verde operation in South America; the Tenke Fungurume minerals district in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); and significant oil and natural gas assets in North America, including reserves in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM), onshore and offshore California, in the Eagle Ford shale play in Texas, in the Haynesville shale plays in Louisiana, in the Madden area in Central Wyoming, and an industry-leading position in the emerging Inboard Lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous natural gas trend in the shallow waters of the GOM and onshore in South Louisiana.\nOur oil and gas subsidiary, FM O&G, formed in the second-quarter 2013, is excluded from our response.\nCopper, molybdenum and cobalt are part of a supply chain on which modern society depends. We are a significant supplier of critical metals to the world\u2019s economies. The generation and transmission of electricity, our means of communications and transportation, and the infrastructure that surrounds us all depend on the metals we produce. In 2013, copper accounted for approximately 69% of our revenues. As we look to the future, copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for energy efficiencies, to advance communications and to enhance public health. Copper\u2019s end- use markets (and their estimated shares of total consumption) are electrical applications 34%, construction 31%, industrial machinery 13%, transportation 13% and consumer products 9%. Molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemical-grade products used in catalysts, lubrication, smoke suppression, corrosion inhibition and pigmentation. Molybdenum, as a high-purity metal, is also used in electronics such as flat-panel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace. Cobalt is widely used in industry, as an important metal in super alloys for jet engines, in healthcare, and in alternative energy.\nOur greenhouse gas emissions are directly correlated to changes in mining production, which is generally correlated to global economic activity. Our current business plans are expected to require increased haul truck fuel consumption caused by longer and steeper material haulage and higher mining rates. As a result, because material haulage is a significant component of our direct emissions profile, without a change in technology applicable to our mining operations, our business plans indicate increasing direct emissions (both absolute and intensity-based emissions) from these existing facilities. Moreover, through attractive ongoing brownfield expansion projects, including those at Cerro Verde, Morenci, and Tenke Fungurume Mining, we are targeting over 5 billion pounds annual copper production by 2015 (37% Increase from 2012). The Company is evaluating other project opportunities to increase product volumes which could be pursued over the next decade. These brownfield expansion projects will also lead to an expected increase in emissions. Nevertheless, Freeport-McMoRan is committed to developing\ngreenhouse gas emission reduction strategies, a number of which are developed at Freeport-McMoRan research and development facilities. One of these strategies is to increase the use of purchased power that comes from renewable or low-carbon sources when feasible.

Freeport-McMoRan is the world's largest publicly traded copper producer.\nFreeport-McMoRan's portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits; significant mining operations in the Americas, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in North America and the Cerro Verde operation in South America; the Tenke Fungurume minerals district in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); and significant oil and natural gas assets in North America, including reserves in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM), onshore and offshore California, in the Eagle Ford shale play in Texas, in the Haynesville shale plays in Louisiana, in the Madden area in Central Wyoming, and an industry-leading position in the emerging Inboard Lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous natural gas trend in the shallow waters of the GOM and onshore in South Louisiana.\nOur oil and gas subsidiary, FM O&G, formed in the second-quarter 2013, is excluded from our response.\nCopper, molybdenum and cobalt are part of a supply chain on which modern society depends. We are a significant supplier of critical metals to the world\u2019s economies. The generation and transmission of electricity, our means of communications and transportation, and the infrastructure that surrounds us all depend on the metals we produce. In 2013, copper accounted for approximately 69% of our revenues. As we look to the future, copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for energy efficiencies, to advance communications and to enhance public health. Copper\u2019s end- use markets (and their estimated shares of total consumption) are electrical applications 34%, construction 31%, industrial machinery 13%, transportation 13% and consumer products 9%. Molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemical-grade products used in catalysts, lubrication, smoke suppression, corrosion inhibition and pigmentation. Molybdenum, as a high-purity metal, is also used in electronics such as flat-panel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace. Cobalt is widely used in industry, as an important metal in super alloys for jet engines, in healthcare, and in alternative energy.\nOur greenhouse gas emissions are directly correlated to changes in mining production, which is generally correlated to global economic activity. Our current business plans are expected to require increased haul truck fuel consumption caused by longer and steeper material haulage and higher mining rates. As a result, because material haulage is a significant component of our direct emissions profile, without a change in technology applicable to our mining operations, our business plans indicate increasing direct emissions (both absolute and intensity-based emissions) from these existing facilities. Moreover, through attractive ongoing brownfield expansion projects, including those at Cerro Verde, Morenci, and Tenke Fungurume Mining, we are targeting over 5 billion pounds annual copper production by 2015 (37% Increase from 2012). The Company is evaluating other project opportunities to increase product volumes which could be pursued over the next decade. These brownfield expansion projects will also lead to an expected increase in emissions. Nevertheless, Freeport-McMoRan is committed to developing\ngreenhouse gas emission reduction strategies, a number of which are developed at Freeport-McMoRan research and development facilities. One of these strategies is to increase the use of purchased power that comes from renewable or low-carbon sources when feasible. A second strategy is to implement energy efficient mineral processing technologies when we are expanding our production. Even with the implementation of these strategies, our business plans anticipate increased total emissions as we respond to increasing demand for our products, principally copper.\nCC0.2\nReporting Year Please state the start and end date of the year for which you are reporting data.

In its risk oversight role, the board reviews, evaluates and discusses with appropriate members of management whether the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate in identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating material risks facing the company. In addition, as reflected in our principles of business conduct, the board seeks to establish a \u201Ctone at the top\u201D communicating the board\u2019s strong commitment to ethical behavior and compliance with the law. While the board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight at the company, its committees assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to certain areas of risk. The Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) of the Board of Directors oversees the Company\u2019s sustainable development programs, including our approach to climate change. The CRC was composed of six Directors in 2013 and reports its activities on a regular basis to the full Board of Directors, including topics related to climate change.\nIn 2009 we established a multi-departmental Greenhouse Gas\/Energy Efficiency Task Force headed by our Vice President \u2013 Technology; our Vice President \u2013 Environmental Services and Sustainable Development provides advisory and management support. In 2012 we combined this task force with our Water Task Force (which focuses on water management). The Energy and Water Task Force addresses climate change topics , and evaluates associated potential business ramifications such as increased product demand, supply chain impacts, operational issues and opportunities (e.g., fuel sources, energy efficiency), and the effects of proposed legislation and new regulatory requirements. The Task Force meets regularly and provides updates of its work to senior management.\nCC1.2\nDo you provide incentives for the management of climate change issues, including the attainment of targets?\nYes\nCC1.2a\nPlease provide further details on the incentives provided for the management of climate change issues\nWho is entitled to benefit from these incentives?\nThe type of incentives Incentivized performance indicator\nAll employees Recognition (non-monetary) Freeport-McMoRan provides internal recognition through publishing short stories on our intranet system of individual employees or groups of employees whose activities further our energy efficiency.\nPage: CC2.

This tool allows us to identify key risks and opportunities across the environmental, social, and economic spectrum. To ensure the process is inclusive, we consider feedback from our stakeholder engagement processes, emerging regulations, industry best practice, and trends tracked by the media, nongovernmental organizations, and researchers. At the site level, each facility has a Sustainable Development Leader who facilitates an identification of risks and opportunities for that site. All the site-specific risks assessment and action plans are compiled into a company-wide SDRR. The corporate Risk Register is distributed to the company\u2019s Sustainable Development Leadership Team. The team is sponsored by our Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. A list of sustainability focus areas is also submitted to the Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors. In addition to the Risk Register, we have a multi-departmental Energy and Water Task Force that addresses climate change issues, energy utilization opportunities, and evaluates associated business ramifications. Risks and opportunities are also assessed at the site and corporate level through periodic meetings of environmental staff in the U.S. We are also a founding member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), a CEO-led organization focused on improving contributions to sustainable development, including climate change. Consequently our membership allows the identification of risks and opportunities at the industry-wide level. Our Project Development Sustainability Review process is used by our project teams to incorporate environmental, social and economic considerations into our development projects at the earliest stages (scoping or pre-feasibility).\nCC2.1c\nHow do you prioritize the risks and opportunities identified?\nThe Freeport-McMoRan Sustainable Development framework is designed for alignment with the ICMM Sustainable Development Framework and implemented based on site-specific factors and influences over the short to long-term. Our framework has evolved over the past five years and operations vary in maturity of its implementation. Essential to our framework is the Sustainable Development Risk Register process which prioritizes environmental, social and economic challenges and opportunities based on our views of potential impacts to the business and the importance of these topics to stakeholders. As part of this process, local management teams utilize a matrix with eight consequence categories including community or environmental aspects, and reputational and production impacts. In 2012, we updated our Sustainable Development Risk Register SOP to increase our level of confidence that we are identifying and addressing key issues for our business and our stakeholders, including an action plan summary format that documents key actions\/milestones with expected completion dates.\nCC2.2\nIs climate change integrated into your business strategy?\nYes\nCC2.2a\nPlease describe the process of how climate change is integrated into your business strategy and any outcomes of this process\nThe Sustainable Development Risk Register, developed as part of Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s sustainability program, is a formal management system for the identification of sustainability issues across all operations. This sustainability Risk Register allows us to identify key risks and opportunities across the environmental (including climate change related), social, and economic spectrum. As a result, the Risk Register is an influential force behind business decisions related to energy efficiency and climate change. As set forth in detail below, this process assists Freeport-McMoRan in developing goals and strategies for greenhouse gas emission reductions.\nThe Sustainable Development Risk Register is core to how Freeport-McMoRan will fulfill its obligations to implement ICMM\u2019s Climate Change Policy (we have this obligation as an ICMM member). All ICMM members have committed to (1) developing greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies and implementing economic emission reduction opportunities; (2) ensuring efficient use of natural resources; (3) supporting research and development of low greenhouse gas emission technologies that are appropriate to the industry; and (4) measuring progress and reporting results.\nThrough development of the corporate Sustainable Development Risk Register and creation of the multi-departmental Energy and Water Task Force, Freeport- McMoRan has determined that the two potential climate change aspects that could affect our operations are increased energy costs and long-term sustainable water availability. In response, there is a corporate-driven effort to evaluate energy efficiency opportunities associated with milling and solution extraction\/electrowinning which are the most significant power consuming processes at our facilities. Mining sites in water-stressed regions maintain water balance models to better understand water uses and to identify system losses (such as entrapment within tailings storage facilities) within the operation. Although the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, operations in water-stressed regions also conduct annual scenario planning to evaluate the potential impacts of hypothetical reductions of total water availability (physical or otherwise caused) and hypothetical extreme precipitation events. This program aims to help us plan to adapt operations to water shortage or extreme surplus time periods. As described below, we recognize the critical link between increased energy consumption associated with the implementation of sustainable large-scale water supply projects.\nThe components of Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s long term strategy are to monitor international legislative and regulatory developments pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards, greenhouse gas reduction schedules, reporting obligations, and to examine opportunities to increase consumption of renewable energy. Freeport-McMoRan will also actively evaluate the business ramifications of potential impacts to energy costs and the demand changes for copper or molybdenum. Furthermore, we continue to engage with energy management experts to discuss the potential for new overarching mining system practices that could be employed to considerably reduce the energy and greenhouse gas intensity of future projects. Subject to ore body characteristics, such step changes would also be predicated on technological innovation in material haulage and we are tracking this evolution closely. Freeport-McMoRan will champion site-specific projects, including considerations for third-party verification of reductions and achievement of the Freeport-McMoRan sustainability targets, that are within our span of control, such as renewable energy proposals relevant to our operations and\/or property holdings, energy efficiency opportunities, and mining equipment purchases or operational improvements (mine planning, fleet management, etc.) that reduce direct emissions. For example, we expect that milling technologies installed as we expand our facilities will deliver significant energy efficiency gains over older milling technology. Based on recent experience, Freeport-McMoRan achieves significant improvements in energy efficiency associated with new processing facilities (including milling technologies). However, these gains do not economically justify, even at a hypothetical $50\/ton carbon tax, the replacement of existing plants solely to improve energy efficiency.\nUtilization of the Sustainable Development Risk Register and Project Development Sustainability Review process (for new projects or expansions) allows us to proactively identify risks and opportunities related to climate change and energy efficiency at the pre-feasibility level and resolve those issues through feasibility studies into project design. Thus, we deal with these identified issues in a proactive manner rather than dealing with these issues in a reactive manner.\nFreeport-McMoRan is assessing the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the Pacific Ocean to treat saltwater for a potential expansion project at our El\nAbra facility located in the Atacama Desert, a water-stressed region, as part of the process to ensure long-term water supply for that project. Our major brownfield expansion project at Cerro Verde near Arequipa, Peru is also located in a water-stressed region. Water for our Cerro Verde mining operation in Peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation. Its existing tailings storage facility also is among the world\u2019s best in terms of water recovery. The operation is constructing a wastewater treatment plant for the city of Arequipa, Peru as it progresses its large-scale expansion, and has obtained authorization to reuse an annual average of one cubic meter per second of the treated water. The plant is expected to improve regional water quality in the Rio Chili, reduce waterborne illnesses and enhance the value of local agricultural products while providing water for an economically important operational expansion for the region.\nCC2.3\nDo you engage in activities that could either directly or indirectly influence public policy on climate change through any of the following?

The Task Force includes senior government relations personnel, meets regularly and provides updates of its work to senior management.\nThe purpose of the Corporate Responsibility Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling the Board\u2019s oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company\u2019s (1) environmental policy and implementation programs, (2) human rights policy and practices, (3) safety and health policies and programs, (4) community health programs and related public health and medical matters, (5) community policy and practices, governmental and stakeholder relations, and social investment and sustainable development programs, (6) charitable contributions and (7) political activity and spending practices.\nPage: CC3. Targets and Initiatives\nCC3.1\nDid you have an emissions reduction target that was active (ongoing or reached completion) in the reporting year?\nNo\nCC3.1e\nPlease explain (i) why you do not have a target; and (ii) forecast how your emissions will change over the next five years\nThe nature of our operations makes an emissions reduction target of the type requested by this questionnaire impractical, if not physically impossible. First, our direct and indirect emissions are directly related to changes in our mining production, which is correlated to global economic conditions. Consequently, changing market conditions, which are outside of our control, require adjustments to our mining rates. Through attractive brownfield expansion projects, including those at Cerro Verde, Morenci, and Tenke Fungurume Mining, we are targeting over 5 billion pounds annual copper production by 2015 (37% Increase from 2012). The Company is evaluating other project opportunities to increase product volumes which could be pursued over the next decade. Consequently, we expect total emissions to increase over this time period. As a result, we have been unable to formulate a realistic absolute or intensity target. We are, however, committed to continuous improvement in our carbon footprint and evaluating options as discussed below that could provide reductions in our emissions in the face of increasing production or physical factors that would otherwise increase emissions.\nA large proportion of our direct emissions are from the operation of haul trucks to move extracted ore to the processing facility. As an open pit matures, haul road length increases and haul trucks are required to move ore an additional distance to the processing facility. Additionally, when market conditions necessitate the\nmining and processing of lower grade ore, haul trucks must move more material. Our current business plans show increased fuel consumption caused by longer and steeper haulage. As such, without a change in applicable technology, which is unavailable at this time, our plans indicate increasing direct emissions (both total and intensity-based emissions) even without increased copper production. Even though business plans estimate an increase in these direct emissions, we are exploring possibilities to mitigate increased emissions from haul truck operation.\nWe are evaluating energy efficiency opportunities associated with milling and solution extraction\/electrowinning, which are the most significant power consuming processes at our facilities. Based on recent experience, Freeport-McMoRan achieves significant improvements in energy efficiency associated with new processing facilities (including milling technologies). However, these gains do not economically justify, even at a hypothetical $50\/ton carbon tax, the replacement of existing plants solely to improve energy efficiency. The breakeven point on this type of replacement would take multiple decades. Nevertheless, we do anticipate that our energy efficiency initiative will lead to a reduction in direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions compared with emissions had those steps not been taken, particularly with implementation of new processing technologies as our production output grows.\nCC3.2\nDoes the use of your goods and\/or services directly enable GHG emissions to be avoided by a third party?\nYes\nCC3.2a\nPlease provide details of how the use of your goods and\/or services directly enable GHG emissions to be avoided by a third party\nFreeport-McMoRan\u2019s products are used in technologies and infrastructure that may help alleviate climate change. Copper is a key component of renewable energy, transportation, power generation and telecommunications systems; it is used in plumbing, wiring, conductivity and connectivity. Molybdenum strengthens steel, resists heat and adds corrosion resistance to piping for water distribution systems and in solar cells. Cobalt is vital to alternative energy applications. These technologies include hybrid vehicles, wind turbines, high efficiency motors, and \u201Cgreen\u201D buildings. The following examples illustrate the importance of our products to technologies that may alleviate climate change.\n\u2022 Electric vehicles consume two to three times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine. Additionally, charging stations needed to fuel these vehicles will increase the size of the power grid. \u2022 Wind turbines consume four to five times the amount of copper per megawatt compared to carbon based power generation. Wind turbines range from 500kW to 7MW in size. \u2022 Solar power consumes incremental copper in terms of electrical grid extension and in small motors attached to each panel needed to follow the sun. \u2022 High efficiency motors consume up to 75% more copper than a standard motor. \u2022 Green buildings require additional meters and other electronics that are essential to optimizing energy use. Additionally, similar concepts will allow the national power grid to become \u201Csmart\u201D. \u2022 Cobalt is used in Lithium ion batteries needed to power hybrid\/electric vehicles and consumer electronics.\nCC3.3\nDid you have emissions reduction initiatives that were active within the reporting year (this can include those in the planning and implementation phases)\nYes\nCC3.3a\nPlease identify the total number of projects at each stage of development, and for those in the implementation stages, the estimated CO2e savings\nStage of development Number of projects Total estimated annual CO2e savings in metric tonnes CO2e (only for rows marked *) Under investigation 4 To be implemented* 0 0 Implementation commenced* 1 1150 Implemented* 7 14683 Not to be implemented 0 0\nCC3.3b\nFor those initiatives implemented in the reporting year, please provide details in the table below\nActivity type Description of activity\nEstimated annual CO2e\nsavings (metric tonnes CO2e)\nAnnual monetary savings\n(unit currency -\nas specified in CC0.4)\nInvestment required\n(unit currency - as specified in\nCC0.4)\nPayback period\nEstimated lifetime of\nthe initiative,\nyears\nComment\nEnergy efficiency: Processes\nFreeport-McMoRan\u2019s Henderson mine in Colorado installed a mill vacuum receiver.

The EPA plans to propose regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from modified and existing power plants in summer 2014. This suite of regulations could increase the cost of electricity production and the cost of purchased power. The magnitude of the impact is uncertain at this time and will depend upon EPA's approach.\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe 1 to 3 years\nDirect\/ Indirect Indirect (Supply chain)\nLikelihood Very likely Magnitude of impact Unknown\nEstimated financial implications\nCopper production is an electricity intensive operation and any regulations that increase the cost of electricity production could increase our operating costs. However, a hypothetical carbon tax of $50\/ton on greenhouse gas emissions (direct and indirect) from our operations in the Americas (based on 2012 data) results in an operating cost increase of less than 10% for U.S. sites. Based on expected future emissions, the associated increase in operating costs do not alter operating plan changes.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan is involved in state regulatory proceedings that are required to allocate the costs of these programs as implemented by regulated utilities. Furthermore, Freeport-McMoRan has developed agreements to purchase solar-produced electricity from the solar installation at our Bagdad, Arizona facility.\nRisk driver Air pollution limits\nCost of management\nFreeport-McMoRan has entered into leasing agreements for the installation of solar energy production at two of our properties. As the lessor, Freeport-McMoRan does not have any capital expenditures for these solar installations. Freeport-McMoRan has a fixed-price agreement to purchase electricity produced at the solar facility installed at our Bagdad, Arizona facility. There is no direct cost to Freeport-McMoRan to engage in the regulatory process.\nRisk driver Emission reporting obligations\nDescription\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated regulations requiring facilities in certain source categories whose emissions exceed threshold levels to report their greenhouse gas emissions. Freeport- McMoRan has four facilities that are required to report emissions pursuant to this program (the smelting operation in Miami, Arizona; the refinery and rod mill in El Paso, Texas; and the mines in Morenci, Arizona and Chino, New Mexico).\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe Up to 1 year\nDirect\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood Virtually certain Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications The EPA\u2019s mandatory reporting rule requires facilities to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions. The primary financial implications have been the development of internal procedures to monitor, track, and calculate these emissions.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan has developed procedures for the calculation and reporting of greenhouse gases.\nCost of management The only costs incurred by Freeport-McMoRan have been internal costs to develop a process to calculate these emissions and internally verify them.\nRisk driver Emission reporting obligations\nDescription New Mexico has promulgated regulations requiring sources in certain categories to report their greenhouse gas emissions.

As the U.S. EPA continues to regulate more sources of greenhouse gases, the price of raw materials and other products may increase.\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe Unknown\nDirect\/ Indirect Indirect (Supply chain)\nLikelihood About as likely as not Magnitude of impact Unknown\nEstimated financial implications\nEPA has begun regulating new major sources of greenhouse gases and major modifications to major sources of greenhouse gases. It is unclear how these regulatory programs will affect the U.S. economy but they could result in an increase in the cost of domestic products. In addition, new permitting requirements for new major sources and major modifications to major sources of greenhouse gasses may increase costs, uncertainty, and timing associated with permitting at our major source facilities.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan engages policymakers through our participation in International Council on Mining and Metals and the Business Roundtable.\nCost of management Costs are reflected in membership dues to these organizations and staff time to participate in the organizations' activities.\nRisk driver Cap and trade schemes\nDescription Freeport-McMoRan's Atlantic Copper smelter in Spain is subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. Potential impact Increased operational cost\nTimeframe Up to 1 year Direct\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood Virtually certain Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s smelter operation in Spain must obtain emission allowances for its greenhouse gas emissions.\nRisk driver Cap and trade schemes\nManagement method Under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, Atlantic Copper obtains free allowances that cover its allowance obligations. Cost of management At this time, there is no cost to Atlantic Copper because its emissions do not exceed its allowance allocation.\nCC5.1b\nPlease describe your risks that are driven by change in physical climate parameters\nRisk driver Change in precipitation extremes and droughts\nDescription The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances. Water is a necessary component in milling copper ore. As a result, any limitation in water availability could affect operations.\nPotential impact Increased operational cost Timeframe 1 to 3 years\nDirect\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood More likely than not Magnitude of impact Medium-high\nEstimated financial implications\nOur operations have sufficient water rights and claims to cover current operational demands. We cannot predict, however, the outcome of pending or future legal proceedings. The loss of some or all water rights or shortages of water could require curtailing or closing production and could prevent expansion opportunities. Providing a quantitative value is purely speculative and would vary depending upon the site affected, the magnitude of water lost, and the cost of finding replacement water.\nManagement method\nFreeport-McMoRan acts proactively to protect its water rights and to evaluate water supply and water quality for existing and possible future requirements, including development of new water sources. In North America, under state law, our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location. In Arizona, Freeport-McMoRan is a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the State of Arizona is quantifying and prioritizing surface water claims for two of the state\u2019s largest river systems that affect four of our mines (Morenci, Sierrita, Miami, and Safford). The precedent in this case may also affect our mine in Bagdad, Arizona. In Colorado, our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and Freeport-McMoRan is involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights. Freeport-McMoRan has initiated a company-wide program that requires improved metering, water balance modeling and prioritization of water management practices, including the implementation of water management plans. All major operations in water stressed regions now maintain a water balance model. In collaboration with communities and host governments we are also working on long-term water supply projects to facilitate co-existence of mining and community development and reduce the likelihood of water resources becoming a conflict driver.\nRisk driver Change in precipitation extremes and droughts\nCost of management The water supply projects that we have and will continue to pursue are capital intensive and most have substantial operating and maintenance costs. With long-lived reserves and a portfolio of brownfield expansion projects, these costs are economically justified particularly when factoring the mutual benefit to communities in regions where we operate.\nCC5.1c\nPlease describe your risks that are driven by changes in other climate-related developments\nRisk driver Reputation\nDescription Climate change is a common topic of interest and debate for some governments, private sector participants, socially responsible investors, and academia. Freeport-McMoRan may face reputational related repercussions if stakeholders determine the company has not adequately addressed climate change issues.\nPotential impact Reduced stock price (market valuation) Timeframe Unknown\nDirect\/ Indirect Direct\nLikelihood About as likely as not Magnitude of impact Unknown\nEstimated financial implications Inaction on climate change could result in stakeholders refusing involvement with or investment in Freeport-McMoRan. However, it is impossible to quantify the financial impact on the company.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan annually participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project and publishes its Working Toward Sustainable Development report that sets forth Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s sustainability policies and actions, including those related to climate change and energy efficiency. Consequently, Freeport-McMoRan attempts to be transparent in its actions associated with climate change.\nCost of management The only costs associated with these actions are internal Freeport-McMoRan costs, such as preparation of the annual Working Toward Sustainable Development document and costs associated in meeting with socially responsible investors.\nPage: CC6. Climate Change Opportunities\nCC6.1\nHave you identified any climate change opportunities that have the potential to generate a substantive change in your business operations, revenue or expenditure? Tick all that apply\nOpportunities driven by changes in regulation Opportunities driven by changes in other climate-related developments\nCC6.1a\nPlease describe your opportunities that are driven by changes in regulation\nOpportunity driver Renewable energy regulation\nDescription\nSeveral U.S. states have instituted short- and long-term goals for the use of renewable energy sources by power providers. Also, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions from new fossil fuel-fired power plants. In 2014, EPA plans to propose regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from modified and existing power plants. This suite of regulations could increase the cost of electricity production at these sources. These policies may increase the value of electricity generated from solar operations. Freeport-McMoRan has been actively engaged in utilizing its substantial property holdings for solar electricity production facilities.\nPotential impact Premium price opportunities Timeframe 1 to 3 years\nDirect\/ Indirect Indirect (Supply chain)\nLikelihood More likely than not Magnitude of impact Low\nEstimated financial implications\nWe have two types of partnerships with solar companies and power providers for the installation of solar facilities. In transactions like those in Ajo, Arizona, we are only the land lessor. The power generated goes to the provider and the financial impact arises from the lease agreement. In transactions like those in Bagdad, Arizona, we are the lessor and have entered into an agreement to purchase the power generated at a fixed rate. Any savings depends upon the relative future electricity cost.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan is actively engaged with solar energy developers to determine whether solar power projects may prove beneficial on any of Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s property. Freeport-McMoRan is also engaged in a University of Arizona pilot project to determine whether solar energy systems may be installed on inactive tailings areas.\nCost of management As the lessor of land for these projects, Freeport-McMoRan does not incur any costs associated with their implementation.\nOpportunity driver Product efficiency regulations and standards\nDescription\nFreeport-McMoRan\u2019s products are used in technologies and infrastructure that may help alleviate climate change. Copper is a key component of renewable energy, transportation, power generation and telecommunications systems; it is used in plumbing, wiring, conductivity and connectivity. Molybdenum strengthens steel, resists heat and adds corrosion resistance to piping for water distribution systems and in solar cells. Cobalt is vital to alternative energy applications. Thus, regulations requiring increased efficiency to slow or halt predicted climate change could potentially increase the demand for these products. These technologies include hybrid vehicles, wind turbines, high efficiency motors, and \u201Cgreen\u201D buildings. The following examples illustrate the importance of our products to technologies that may alleviate climate change. \u2022 Electric vehicles consume two to three times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine. Additionally, charging stations needed to fuel these vehicles will increase the size of the power grid. \u2022 Wind turbines consume four to five times the amount of copper per megawatt compared to carbon based power generation. Wind turbines range from 500kW to 7MW in size. \u2022 Solar power consumes incremental copper in terms of electrical grid extension and in small motors attached to each panel needed to follow the sun. \u2022 High efficiency motors consume up to 75% more copper than a standard motor. \u2022 Green buildings require additional meters and other electronics that are essential to optimizing energy use. Additionally, similar concepts will allow the national power grid to become \u201Csmart\u201D. \u2022 Cobalt is used in Lithium ion batteries needed to power hybrid\/electric vehicles and consumer electronics.\nPotential impact Increased demand for existing products\/services Timeframe Unknown\nDirect\/ Indirect Indirect (Client)\nLikelihood About as likely as not Magnitude of impact Unknown\nEstimated financial implications While copper and other metals produced by Freeport-McMoRan are an important component of technologies used to reduce or avoid climate change emissions (e.g., hybrid vehicles, wind turbines, high efficiency motors, and \u201Cgreen\u201D buildings), it is impossible to quantify the financial implications for Freeport-McMoRan of the use of larger quantities of these materials.\nManagement method Freeport-McMoRan does not take any action that directly advocates use of alternative technologies that utilize more copper or other products.\nCost of management There are no costs to Freeport-McMoRan for the increased use of technologies that reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and that also use high levels of copper or other Freeport-McMoRan products.\nCC6.1c\nPlease describe the opportunities that are driven by changes in other climate-related developments\nOpportunity driver Changing consumer behaviour\nDescription\nFreeport-McMoRan\u2019s products are used in technologies and infrastructure that may help alleviate climate change.

Generally, Freeport-McMoRan operates mining operations, copper smelters, molybdenum conversion facilities, and copper rod plants. As a result, Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s primary products require processing before they are used by the ultimate consumer or are incorporated into products. Freeport-McMoRan analyzed whether changes in physical climate parameters such as temperature or precipitation (either extremes or on average) may present opportunities in our business operations. Changes in physical climate parameters did not present any direct opportunity for Freeport-McMoRan. Furthermore, Freeport-McMoRan has not been able to identify any downstream products that respond to changes in physical climate parameters (i.e., temperature or precipitation) that may increase in sales of copper or other metals.\nModule: GHG Emissions Accounting, Energy and Fuel Use, and Trading\nPage: CC7.

For example, the majority of copper concentrate product produced at Freeport-McMoRan mines is smelted by Freeport-McMoRan-owned smelters and the majority of copper anodes produced by the smelter are processed in Freeport-McMoRan owned Refineries. However, some concentrate and anodes are sold to third parties for smelting. The emissions reported here only represent emissions from the smelting of concentrate and the refining of copper anodes sold to third parties. Emissions were calculated by applying the average emissions at Freeport-McMoRan smelters and refinery to the amount of concentrate and anodes sold to third parties. The result was rounded to 2 significant digits.\nUse of sold products\nNot relevant, explanation provided\nAs a producer of commodities, all products produced by Freeport- McMoRan require further processing for use.
