Freeport-McMoRan is the world's largest publicly traded copper producer.\nFreeport-McMoRan's portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits; significant mining operations in the Americas, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in North America and the Cerro Verde operation in South America; the Tenke Fungurume minerals district in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); and significant oil and natural gas assets in North America, including reserves in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM), onshore and offshore California, in the Eagle Ford shale play in Texas, in the Haynesville shale plays in Louisiana, in the Madden area in Central Wyoming, and an industry-leading position in the emerging Inboard Lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous natural gas trend in the shallow waters of the GOM and onshore in South Louisiana.\nOur oil and gas subsidiary, FM O&G, formed in the second-quarter 2013, is excluded from our response.\nCopper, molybdenum and cobalt are part of a supply chain on which modern society depends. We are a significant supplier of critical metals to the world\u2019s economies. The generation and transmission of electricity, our means of communications and transportation, and the infrastructure that surrounds us all depend on the metals we produce. In 2013, copper accounted for approximately 69% of our revenues. As we look to the future, copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for energy efficiencies, to advance communications and to enhance public health. Copper\u2019s end- use markets (and their estimated shares of total consumption) are electrical applications 34%, construction 31%, industrial machinery 13%, transportation 13% and consumer products 9%. Molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemical-grade products used in catalysts, lubrication, smoke suppression, corrosion inhibition and pigmentation. Molybdenum, as a high-purity metal, is also used in electronics such as flat-panel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace. Cobalt is widely used in industry, as an important metal in super alloys for jet engines, in healthcare, and in alternative energy.\nOur greenhouse gas emissions are directly correlated to changes in mining production, which is generally correlated to global economic activity. Our current business plans are expected to require increased haul truck fuel consumption caused by longer and steeper material haulage and higher mining rates. As a result, because material haulage is a significant component of our direct emissions profile, without a change in technology applicable to our mining operations, our business plans indicate increasing direct emissions (both absolute and intensity-based emissions) from these existing facilities.

Cobalt is widely used in industry as an important metal in super alloys for jet engines, in healthcare, in batteries, and in alternative energy.\nIn general, the societal benefits in reducing global CO2 levels are tied to the increasing use of our products, particularly copper, in energy efficient applications that include electric vehicles. We strive to operate in the most energy efficient manner so the end use of our products can provide the largest leverage in reducing global CO2 emissions.\nPage 2 of 40\nC","Company_id":"5eed27ea4fe2bd337cd15baa","Name":"Freeport-McMoRan"},"Scope 3":{"CO2":null},"Scope 2":{"StartDate":"2016-01-01","CO2":4923748,"EndDate":"2016-12-31","CO2 market based":null},"ReportingStandard":"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol","Source":"https:\/\/fcx.com\/sites\/fcx\/files\/documents\/sustainability\/2017_cdp_climate_change_info_req.pdf"}}
