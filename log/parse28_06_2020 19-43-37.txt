We deliver on this through a strategy of responsible growth and a focus on environmental, social and governance leadership. Through these efforts, we are driving growth\u2014investing in the success of our employees, and helping to create jobs, develop communities, foster economic mobility and address society\u2019s biggest challenges\u2014while managing risk and providing a return to our clients and our business. As evidenced by the most recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report and the United States government\u2019s Fourth National Climate Assessment, urgent action is needed to address climate change and prevent its increasingly devastating impacts from accelerating further. At Bank of America, we recognize that climate change poses a significant risk to our business, our clients and the communities where we live and work.\n1\nBank of America CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2019 Tuesday, July 30, 2019\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, Bank of America has a responsibility and an important role to play in helping to mitigate and build resilience to climate change by using our expertise and resources, as well as our scale, to accelerate the transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon society. In alignment with more than 190 countries, we support the Paris Agreement on climate change, its commitment to take action to keep global temperature rise this century to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and its efforts to limit the temperature increase to no more than 1.5°C. Doing so will require changes in all sectors of our economy, particularly the transformation of critical areas like energy, power, transportation and real estate. Bank of America will mobilize an additional $300 billion in capital by 2030 through its Environmental Business Initiative. This third commitment increases the company\u2019s investment in low-carbon business activities as part of its focus on deploying capital for responsible, sustainable growth. Through lending, investing, capital raising, advisory services and developing financing solutions, this new commitment will drive innovation and help to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy. The $300 billion goal brings Bank of America\u2019s total commitment to more than $445 billion since 2007, when the company issued its first Environmental Business Initiative. Bank of America has deployed more than $126 billion over the past 12 years in support of environmental business efforts across the globe. In 2013, Bank of America issued its second Environmental Business Initiative commitment with a goal to deploy $125 billion by 2025. The company will achieve this commitment by the end of 2019, six years ahead of schedule.","Company_id":"5eed24fe4fe2bd337ccab4e8","Name":"Bank of America"},"Scope 3":{"CO2":2004292},"Scope 2":{"StartDate":"2018-01-01","CO2":791166,"EndDate":"2018-12-31","CO2 market based":108614},"ReportingStandard":"Other, please specify Multiple","Source":{"URL":"https:\/\/about.bankofamerica.com\/assets\/pdf\/2019_CDP_Climate_Change_Submission_Secure.pdf"}}}

The Group is a worldwide leader in the habitat and construction markets, providing\ncomfort, performance and safety while addressing the challenges of sustainable construction,\nresource efficiency and climate change all over the world. As a growing number of countries\npass new regulations in favor of more energy-efficient buildings, it encourages the introduction\nof innovative construction techniques for new buildings along with new insulation standards for\nrenovation projects. At the same time, urbanization is a major trend that is affecting the\nconstruction market in both developed and emerging countries. The rapid exponential growth in\ninfrastructure needs and increasing demand for energy-efficient solutions represent valuable\nopportunities for Saint-Gobain. With its unique positioning, Saint-Gobain is among the first to\nbenefit from the environmentally led growth in the construction market. Innovation is at the\nheart of Saint-Gobain\u2019s strategy. To support that vision and continuously improve its processes\nand products, Saint-Gobain invests heavily in R and D. For the past eight years, the Group has\nbeen ranked in the Top 100 Innovators by Clarivate. Over 80% of the Group\u2019s sales occur in\nthe construction markets, including new construction, renovation, civil engineering and\ninfrastructure.

Saint-Gobain's previous structure relied on a matrix-\nbased system with three Sectors of activity (Innovative Materials, Construction Products,\nBuilding Distribution) and 14 General Delegations coordinating the Group's actions and\nrepresenting it in its various countries. The new structure is as follows: - Activities in regional\nmarkets (activities from the former Building Distribution and Construction Products, as well as\nbuilding glass) are now organized by country and consolidated into four regions (Northern\nEurope; Southern Europe, Middle-East, Africa; Americas; Asia-Pacific). In markets where\nproducts and services are supplied locally and mostly have short distances to cover, the\nstructure per country and region will leverage Saint-Gobain's strengths to meet the specific\nneeds of each local market. - A High Performance Solutions entity is responsible for global\nmarket activities (corresponding to the former High-Performance Materials Sector as well as the\nautomotive glazing activities). These are products and services with a high unit value that can\nbe shipped over long distances and whose value is often created through co-innovation with\ncustomers and bespoke technologies. The High Performance Solutions BUs provide the best\nservice to the various markets with three market-oriented BUs (Mobility, Life sciences,\nSaint-Gobain CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2019 Thursday, July 4, 2019\n2\nConstruction Industry) and two BUs serving industry more generally (one channel-oriented\nAbrasives and Composite Systems BU and one product-oriented Ceramics BU). To showcase\nand monitor its strong engagement towards sustainability, Saint-Gobain has set for itself a\nnumber of ambitious targets in the areas of environment including CO2 emissions and energy\nconsumption. Those targets are set up for the plants being representative of the impact of the\nGroup. In 2018, around 500 plants are concerned.

(Ryder), a Florida corporation founded in 1933, is a global leader in commercial fleet management and supply chain solutions. We operate primarily in three business segments: Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), Dedicated Transportation Services (DTS) and Supply Chain Solutions (SCS). Ryder has received significant awards and recognition from customers, leading transportation and logistics industry associations, business and regulatory communities. Recent examples include: Forbes: America\u2019s Best Employers in Transportation and Logistics industry category (2016-2018); FORTUNE: World\u2019s Most Admired Companies Award in Trucking Industry (2016-2018); SupplyChainBrain - 100 Great Supply Chain Partners award (2017); Trucking HR Canada \u2013 Top Fleet Employers (2018); Carbon Disclosure Project Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (2012, 2015); Food Logistics: Top Green Providers award for green transportation and logistics solutions (2012 \u2013 2017); Inbound Logistics - top 75 Green Supply Chain Partners by Inbound Logistics (2009\u2013 2017); Supply & Demand Chain Executive: Green Supply Chain Award for meeting green or sustainable supply chain goals (2016-2017); 2020 Women on Boards W Company \u2013 Ryder was named a \u201CW\u201D company for having a board with more than 20 percent women (2013, 2017); CivilianJobs.com\u2019s Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military (2013 - 2017); Florida Diversity Council: Most Powerful and Influential Women Award (2017); SmartWay Excellence Award (2017).The FMS business provides full service leasing (long-term), commercial rental (short-term), as well as contract maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The standard leasing business model offers customers different vehicle options (such as fuel-efficient or natural gas powered vehicle packages) with attractive financing mechanisms. Because of increased demand for vehicle efficiency and reliability, companies that own and manage their own fleet of vehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of preventative maintenance for their vehicles. In addition, several trends have been increasing the need for outsourcing: increased complexity and cost of buying and maintaining vehicles including technology, diagnostics, and training; labor issues including a shortage of qualified truck drivers and mechanics; as well as increased regulation \u2013 e.g. more expensive emission controls needed for EPA-compliant engines - and enforcement of safety requirements. Under the FMS Full Service Lease option, Ryder offers vehicle maintenance services, supplies and related equipment necessary for operating and maintaining lease vehicles. This applies to customers who want to manage their own freight, but are interested in outsourcing or upgrading their fleet\nmanagement needs without having to invest their own capital. Under the FMS Commercial Rental option, customers who need to supplement their fleet on a short-term basis are able to rent vehicles for a day, a week, a month, or on a multi-year rental contract. The Dedicated Transportation Service (DTS) option provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicate transportation solution in the\nUS. Customers directly manage their overall freight movement but Ryder provides the equipment, maintenance, and administrative services (including driver hiring, training, routing and scheduling, and fleet sizing) associated with maintaining the customer\u2019s private fleet. This combination of services allow us to provide high service levels and the most efficient routing to lower fuel costs due to less idle time and fewer empty miles. A key difference between Dedicated Transportation Services and Full Service Lease is Ryder provides the drivers for Dedicated. The SCS supply chain solution provides Distribution and Transportation Management services in North America and Asia. SCS customers are looking for a total integrated solution that includes managing outsourced vehicles, drivers, freight routing, IT integration, warehouse and distribution management, as well as other logistics engineering services. SCS provides a wide range of services relating to a customer\u2019s distribution operations, from designing the distribution network to managing distribution facilities. Customers can more precisely align inbound and outbound shipments, synchronize returns with optimized fleet use and arrange backhauls to offset transportation costs and minimize empty miles that will directly help lowering GHG emissions.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms \u201CVF,\u201D the \"Company,\u201D \u201Cwe,\u201D \u201Cus,\u201D and \u201Cour\u201D used herein refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nVF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, denim, backpack, luggage, accessory and apparel categories. Our largest brands are Vans®, The North Face®, Timberland®, Wrangler® and Lee®.\nOur products are marketed to consumers through our wholesale channel, primarily in specialty stores, department stores, national chains, mass merchants, independently- operated partnership stores and with strategic digital partners. Our products are also marketed to consumers through our own direct-to-consumer operations, which include VF-operated stores, concession retail stores and brand e-commerce sites. Revenues from the direct-to-consumer business represented 33% of VF\u2019s total Fiscal 2019 revenues. In addition to selling directly into international markets, many of our brands also sell products through licensees, agents and distributors. In Fiscal 2019, VF derived 65% of its revenues from the Americas region, 24% from the Europe region and 11% from the Asia-Pacific region.\nTo provide diversified products across multiple channels of distribution in different geographic areas, we balance our own manufacturing capabilities with sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors. We utilize state-of-the-art technologies for inventory replenishment that enable us to effectively and efficiently get the right assortment of products that match consumer demand.\nV.F. Corporation has seen a major reorganization to its business, including the change of our fiscal year from calendar year to the fiscal year starting in April and the spinoff of the Wrangler® and Lee® brands on May 23, 2019. Where there is backward-looking data, Kontoor brands, Wrangler® and Lee®, are still included as a part of our portfolio; where future-facing risks and opportunities are considered, Kontoor brands are excluded.","Company_id":"5eed2cc84fe2bd337cdcd25c","Name":"V.F"},"Scope 3":{"CO2":4569194},"Scope 2":{"StartDate":"2018-01-01","CO2":160423,"EndDate":"2018-12-31","CO2 market based":140488},"ReportingStandard":"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol","Source":{"URL":"https:\/\/d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net\/vfc\/files\/documents\/Sustainability\/Resources\/VF+Corporatation+2019+CDP+Climate+Change+Response.pdf"}}}

Freeport-McMoRan is the world's largest publicly traded copper producer.\nFreeport-McMoRan's portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits; significant mining operations in the Americas, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in North America and the Cerro Verde operation in South America; the Tenke Fungurume minerals district in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); and significant oil and natural gas assets in North America, including reserves in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM), onshore and offshore California, in the Eagle Ford shale play in Texas, in the Haynesville shale plays in Louisiana, in the Madden area in Central Wyoming, and an industry-leading position in the emerging Inboard Lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous natural gas trend in the shallow waters of the GOM and onshore in South Louisiana.\nOur oil and gas subsidiary, FM O&G, formed in the second-quarter 2013, is excluded from our response.\nCopper, molybdenum and cobalt are part of a supply chain on which modern society depends. We are a significant supplier of critical metals to the world\u2019s economies. The generation and transmission of electricity, our means of communications and transportation, and the infrastructure that surrounds us all depend on the metals we produce. In 2013, copper accounted for approximately 69% of our revenues. As we look to the future, copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for energy efficiencies, to advance communications and to enhance public health. Copper\u2019s end- use markets (and their estimated shares of total consumption) are electrical applications 34%, construction 31%, industrial machinery 13%, transportation 13% and consumer products 9%. Molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemical-grade products used in catalysts, lubrication, smoke suppression, corrosion inhibition and pigmentation. Molybdenum, as a high-purity metal, is also used in electronics such as flat-panel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace. Cobalt is widely used in industry, as an important metal in super alloys for jet engines, in healthcare, and in alternative energy.\nOur greenhouse gas emissions are directly correlated to changes in mining production, which is generally correlated to global economic activity. Our current business plans are expected to require increased haul truck fuel consumption caused by longer and steeper material haulage and higher mining rates. As a result, because material haulage is a significant component of our direct emissions profile, without a change in technology applicable to our mining operations, our business plans indicate increasing direct emissions (both absolute and intensity-based emissions) from these existing facilities. Moreover, through attractive ongoing brownfield expansion projects, including those at Cerro Verde, Morenci, and Tenke Fungurume Mining, we are targeting over 5 billion pounds annual copper production by 2015 (37% Increase from 2012).

One of these strategies is to increase the use of purchased power that comes from renewable or low-carbon sources when feasible.

Freeport-McMoRan operates large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold, molybdenum, cobalt, oil and natural gas. The Company has a dynamic portfolio of operating, expansion and growth projects in the copper industry. Freeport-McMoRan is also the world\u2019s largest producer of molybdenum and a significant gold, oil, and natural gas producer.\nFreeport-McMoRan's portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits; significant mining operations in the Americas, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in North America and the Cerro Verde operation in South America; the Tenke Fungurume minerals district in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); and oil and natural gas assets in North America, including growth potential in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, established oil production facilities onshore and offshore California, large onshore natural gas resources in the Haynesville shale in Louisiana, natural gas production from the Madden area in Central Wyoming and an industry-leading position in the emerging Inboard Lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous gas trend located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in South Louisiana.\nOur oil and gas subsidiary, FM O&G, is excluded from our response. While our oil and gas operations are excluded from the boundary of this report, FM O&G operates in accordance with all Freeport-McMoRan policies and governance structures. Operating in a highly-regulated industry in the U.S., FM O&G maintains audited safety and environmental management systems and emergency response procedures. During 2014, we completed sales of our 80 percent ownership interests in the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado copper mining operations which are also excluded from the report boundary.\nCopper, molybdenum, and cobalt are part of a supply chain on which modern society depends. We are a significant supplier of critical metals to the world\u2019s economies. The generation and transmission of electricity, our means of communications and transportation, and the infrastructure that surrounds us all depend on the metals we produce. In 2014, copper accounted for approximately 60% of our revenues. As we look to the future, copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for energy efficiencies, to advance communications and to enhance public health. Copper\u2019s end-use markets (and their estimated shares of total consumption) are construction 30%, consumer products 28%, electrical applications 19%, transportation 12% and industrial machinery 11%. Molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemical-grade products used in catalysts, lubrication, smoke suppression, corrosion inhibition, and pigmentation. Molybdenum, as a high-purity metal, is also used in electronics such as flat-panel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace.

(Ryder), a Florida corporation founded in 1933, is a global leader in commercial fleet management and supply chain solutions. We operate primarily in three business segments: Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), Dedicated Transportation Services (DTS) and Supply Chain Solutions (SCS). Ryder has received significant awards and recognition from customers, leading transportation and logistics industry associations, business and regulatory communities. Recent examples include: Forbes: America\u2019s Best Employers in Transportation and Logistics industry category (2016); FORTUNE: World\u2019s Most Admired Companies Award in Trucking Industry (2016); Texas Oil & Gas Award (2016) for environmental stewardship, corporate social responsibility, and excellence in health & safety; SupplyChainBrain - 100 Great Supply Chain Partners award; Trucking HR Canada \u2013 Award for top trucking companies in Canada; Carbon Disclosure Project Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (2012, 2015); Food Logistics: Top Green Providers award for green transportation and logistics solutions (2012 \u2013 2016); Inbound Logistics - top 75 Green Supply Chain Partners by Inbound Logistics (2009\u2013 2016); Supply & Demand Chain Executive: Green Supply Chain Award for meeting green or sustainable supply chain goals (2016); 2020 Women on Boards W Company \u2013 Ryder was named a \u201CW\u201D company for having a board with more than 20 percent women (2013, 2017); CivilianJobs.com\u2019s Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military (2013 - 2016); Florida Diversity Council: Most Powerful and Influential Woman Award (2017); 2016 Partnership Award Bacardi: Through its US EPA SmartWay partnership with Ryder, Inc., beginning in 2008, Bacardi USA has vastly improved transportation efficiencies and reduced carbon emissions by more than 20%. The FMS business provides full service leasing (long-term), commercial rental (short-term), as well as contract maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The standard leasing business model offers customers different vehicle options (such as fuel-efficient or natural gas powered vehicle packages) with attractive financing mechanisms. Because of increased demand for vehicle efficiency and reliability, companies that own and manage their own fleet of vehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of preventative maintenance for their vehicles. Finally, the tightened credit market has limited some businesses\u2019 access to capital at a time when commercial vehicle costs have increased due to new technologies and more expensive emission controls needed for EPA-compliant engines. Under the FMS Full Service Lease option, Ryder offers vehicle maintenance services, supplies and related equipment necessary for operating and maintaining lease vehicles. This applies to customers who want to manage their own freight, but are interested in outsourcing or upgrading their fleet management needs without having to invest their own capital. Under the FMS Commercial Rental option, customers who need to supplement their fleet on a short-term basis are able to rent vehicles for a day, a week, a month, or on a multi-year rental contract. The Dedicated Transportation Service (DTS) option provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicate transportation solution in the US. Customers directly manage their overall freight movement but Ryder provides the equipment, maintenance, and administrative services (including driver hiring, training, routing and scheduling,\nand fleet sizing) associated with maintaining the customer\u2019s private fleet. This combination of services allow us to provide high service levels and the most efficient routing to lower fuel costs due to less idle time and fewer empty miles. A key difference between Dedicated Transportation Services and Full Service Lease is Ryder provides the drivers for Dedicated. The SCS supply chain solution provides Distribution and Transportation Management services in North America and Asia. SCS customers are looking for a total integrated solution that includes managing outsourced vehicles, drivers, freight routing, IT integration, warehouse and distribution management, as well as other logistics engineering services. SCS provides a wide range of services relating to a customer\u2019s distribution operations, from designing the distribution network to managing distribution facilities. Customers can more precisely align inbound and outbound shipments, synchronize returns with optimized fleet use and arrange backhauls to offset transportation costs and minimize empty miles that will directly help lowering GHG emissions.
