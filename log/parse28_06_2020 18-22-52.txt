(\u201CVMware\u201D) originally pioneered the development and application of virtualization technologies with x86 server-based computing, separating application software from the underlying hardware. Information technology (\u201CIT\u201D) driven innovation continues to disrupt markets and industries. Technologies emerge faster than organizations can absorb, creating increasingly complex environments. IT is working at an accelerated pace to harness new technologies, platforms and cloud models, ultimately guiding their business through a digital transformation. To take on these challenges, we are working with customers in the areas of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, modern applications, networking and security, and digital workspaces. Our software provides a flexible digital foundation to help enable customers in their digital transformation.\nWe help customers manage their IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments by offering solutions across three categories: Software-Defined Data Center (\u201CSDDC\u201D), Hybrid Cloud Computing and End-User Computing (\u201CEUC\u201D). This portfolio supports and addresses the key IT priorities of our customers: accelerating their cloud journey, empowering digital workspaces and transforming networking and security. These VMware solutions enable the digital transformation our customers need as they ready their applications, infrastructure and devices for their future business needs.\nWe incorporated in Delaware in 1998, were acquired by EMC Corporation (\u201CEMC\u201D) in 2004 and conducted our initial public offering of our Class A common stock in August 2007.

We are the world\u2019s largest thin film PV solar\nmodule manufacturer and one of the world\u2019s largest PV solar module manufacturers. Our\nmission is to provide cost-advantaged solar technology through innovation, customer\nengagement, industry leadership, and operational excellence.\nFirst Solar's proven solar solutions diversify the energy portfolio and reduce the risk of fuel-\nprice volatility while delivering a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) that is cost competitive with\nfossil fuels today. First Solar has set the benchmark for environmentally responsible product life\ncycle management by introducing the industry's first global and comprehensive recycling\nprogram for solar modules. We are committed to minimizing the environmental impacts and\nenhancing the social and economic benefits of our products and projects across their life cycle,\nfrom raw material sourcing through product end-of-life. For more information about First Solar,\nplease visit www.firstsolar.com\nFirst Solar was founded in 1999 and began commercial production in 2002. Since 2002 and\nthrough 2018, we have sold over 20 GW of PV solar modules. Assuming average worldwide\nirradiance and grid electricity emissions, our products are being used to displace approximately\n14 million metric tons of CO2e per year during their 25+ year product life. This is equivalent to\npowering around 10 million average homes, planting 233 million trees and saving 36 billion\nliters of water (or 14000+ Olympic swimming pools) per year based on worldwide averages.","Company_id":"5eed24fd4fe2bd337ccab28a","Name":"First Solar"},"Scope 3":{"CO2":388421},"Scope 2":{"StartDate":"2018-01-01","CO2":427890,"EndDate":"2018-12-31","CO2 market based":334088},"ReportingStandard":"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol","Source":{"URL":"http:\/\/www.firstsolar.com\/en-EMEA\/-\/media\/First-Solar\/Sustainability-Documents\/2019-CDP-Climate-Change-Questionnaire---First-Solar.ashx"}}}

The Group is a worldwide leader in the habitat and construction markets, providing\ncomfort, performance and safety while addressing the challenges of sustainable construction,\nresource efficiency and climate change all over the world. As a growing number of countries\npass new regulations in favor of more energy-efficient buildings, it encourages the introduction\nof innovative construction techniques for new buildings along with new insulation standards for\nrenovation projects. At the same time, urbanization is a major trend that is affecting the\nconstruction market in both developed and emerging countries. The rapid exponential growth in\ninfrastructure needs and increasing demand for energy-efficient solutions represent valuable\nopportunities for Saint-Gobain. With its unique positioning, Saint-Gobain is among the first to\nbenefit from the environmentally led growth in the construction market. Innovation is at the\nheart of Saint-Gobain\u2019s strategy. To support that vision and continuously improve its processes\nand products, Saint-Gobain invests heavily in R and D. For the past eight years, the Group has\nbeen ranked in the Top 100 Innovators by Clarivate.

The new structure is as follows: - Activities in regional\nmarkets (activities from the former Building Distribution and Construction Products, as well as\nbuilding glass) are now organized by country and consolidated into four regions (Northern\nEurope; Southern Europe, Middle-East, Africa; Americas; Asia-Pacific). In markets where\nproducts and services are supplied locally and mostly have short distances to cover, the\nstructure per country and region will leverage Saint-Gobain's strengths to meet the specific\nneeds of each local market. - A High Performance Solutions entity is responsible for global\nmarket activities (corresponding to the former High-Performance Materials Sector as well as the\nautomotive glazing activities). These are products and services with a high unit value that can\nbe shipped over long distances and whose value is often created through co-innovation with\ncustomers and bespoke technologies. The High Performance Solutions BUs provide the best\nservice to the various markets with three market-oriented BUs (Mobility, Life sciences,\nSaint-Gobain CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2019 Thursday, July 4, 2019\n2\nConstruction Industry) and two BUs serving industry more generally (one channel-oriented\nAbrasives and Composite Systems BU and one product-oriented Ceramics BU).

Recent examples include: Forbes: America\u2019s Best Employers in Transportation and Logistics industry category (2016-2018); FORTUNE: World\u2019s Most Admired Companies Award in Trucking Industry (2016-2018); SupplyChainBrain - 100 Great Supply Chain Partners award (2017); Trucking HR Canada \u2013 Top Fleet Employers (2018); Carbon Disclosure Project Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (2012, 2015); Food Logistics: Top Green Providers award for green transportation and logistics solutions (2012 \u2013 2017); Inbound Logistics - top 75 Green Supply Chain Partners by Inbound Logistics (2009\u2013 2017); Supply & Demand Chain Executive: Green Supply Chain Award for meeting green or sustainable supply chain goals (2016-2017); 2020 Women on Boards W Company \u2013 Ryder was named a \u201CW\u201D company for having a board with more than 20 percent women (2013, 2017); CivilianJobs.com\u2019s Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military (2013 - 2017); Florida Diversity Council: Most Powerful and Influential Women Award (2017); SmartWay Excellence Award (2017).The FMS business provides full service leasing (long-term), commercial rental (short-term), as well as contract maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The standard leasing business model offers customers different vehicle options (such as fuel-efficient or natural gas powered vehicle packages) with attractive financing mechanisms. Because of increased demand for vehicle efficiency and reliability, companies that own and manage their own fleet of vehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of preventative maintenance for their vehicles. In addition, several trends have been increasing the need for outsourcing: increased complexity and cost of buying and maintaining vehicles including technology, diagnostics, and training; labor issues including a shortage of qualified truck drivers and mechanics; as well as increased regulation \u2013 e.g. more expensive emission controls needed for EPA-compliant engines - and enforcement of safety requirements. Under the FMS Full Service Lease option, Ryder offers vehicle maintenance services, supplies and related equipment necessary for operating and maintaining lease vehicles. This applies to customers who want to manage their own freight, but are interested in outsourcing or upgrading their fleet\nmanagement needs without having to invest their own capital. Under the FMS Commercial Rental option, customers who need to supplement their fleet on a short-term basis are able to rent vehicles for a day, a week, a month, or on a multi-year rental contract. The Dedicated Transportation Service (DTS) option provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicate transportation solution in the\nUS. Customers directly manage their overall freight movement but Ryder provides the equipment, maintenance, and administrative services (including driver hiring, training, routing and scheduling, and fleet sizing) associated with maintaining the customer\u2019s private fleet. This combination of services allow us to provide high service levels and the most efficient routing to lower fuel costs due to less idle time and fewer empty miles. A key difference between Dedicated Transportation Services and Full Service Lease is Ryder provides the drivers for Dedicated. The SCS supply chain solution provides Distribution and Transportation Management services in North America and Asia. SCS customers are looking for a total integrated solution that includes managing outsourced vehicles, drivers, freight routing, IT integration, warehouse and distribution management, as well as other logistics engineering services. SCS provides a wide range of services relating to a customer\u2019s distribution operations, from designing the distribution network to managing distribution facilities. Customers can more precisely align inbound and outbound shipments, synchronize returns with optimized fleet use and arrange backhauls to offset transportation costs and minimize empty miles that will directly help lowering GHG emissions.
